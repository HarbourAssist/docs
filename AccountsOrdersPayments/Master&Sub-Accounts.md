# Master & Sub-Accounts

Sometimes you might have an account under one name but is associated to another account, such as a junior membership attached to an adult membership account.

Like a Boat Relationship, you can attach a Sub-account to a Master Account and vice versa, creating a link between the two.

In the Account, go to the Account tab and on the right, select the appropriate option to attach the account you are on to either a Master Account or a Sub-Account.

Use the search tool to find the account you want to attach to and select the correct one from the list.

The Account details will update to show the attached account.

The attached account will automatically update accordingly to show the same connection.

?> NB: Attaching accounts does not merge or link in any way the financial information of either account.  It is simply a way of seeing any relationship between accounts.
