# Plaques

Plaques are a tool that can be used against a boat for anything that you issue to a customer that has a number; things such as Harbour Dues stickers, car parking permits or a membership card.

You can have as many Plaque Types as you like and if you require any setting up just let us know by submitting a support ticket.
