# Lookups #

Lookups are the drop down lists that appear on the Account and Boat Details pages - they are there to help speed up the process of entering data.

You can add to and edit the Lookups by accessing them through the Administration tile on the *Home* page.

Select the Lookup list that you wish to edit or add to by clicking on the name.  In this example we are adding to *Account Archive Reasons*.  You will be shown the full details of that Lookup list.  To add to the list click on *New Lookup*.
