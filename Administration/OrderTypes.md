# Order Types #

## Explaining Order Types ##

**Order Types** are a description of the goods or services that are being provided and purchased.

Once an Account is created with an *Account Type* (see below for more information) an Order can be raised.   Multiple orders with different **Order Types** can be raised for an Account.

?> More documentation on Accounts can be found [here](AccountsOrdersPayments/Accounts)

Each Order is assigned a single **Order Type**, and the **Order Type** will determine:-

- The *Tariffs* available for composing the Order (see Tariffs and Pricebooks)
- The Invoice/Receipt template format
- Whether an Occupancy should be created and what type of Occupancy
- Custom Order-level data capture.

?> More documentation on Tariffs and Pricebooks can be found [here](AccountsOrdersPayments/TariffsPricebooks)

**Order Types** are bespoke to each business using the Harbour Assist system. 

Amendments to existing **Order Types** and creation of new ones can be carried out by Users who have the relevant permissions to enable them to do so.

## Adding Tariffs to an Order Type

You can restrict the Tariffs that are available to be added to an Order Type to help guide Users to use the correct Tariff.  By default only these tariffs will show for selection when adding tariffs to an Order.

Click on the *Tariffs* Tab.

Even though you only want certain Tariffs to show by default for a certain Order Type, there may be occasions when other Tariffs need to be added.  For instance, whilst raising an order for a Leisure Mooring the customer may also want to purchase a gas bottle at the same time.  To give flexibility to Users to add items such as this, ensure the *Allow User to Override Visible Tariffs* box is ticked.

![image-20230424151932928](image-20230424151932928.png)

Any Tariff already attached to this Order Type will appear on the right, and you can select any available Tariffs using the tool on the left.

![image-20230424152036661](image-20230424152036661.png)

To add a Tariff to your Order Type, click on the *Filter by Category* drop-down box.

Select a Category, and the Tariffs available will appear in a list underneath. 

![image-20230424152222194](image-20230424152222194.png)

To add a Tariff to your Order type, click on the ![image-20230424152301904](image-20230424152301904.png)

The selected Tariffs will appear on the right hand side, and the ![image-20230424152311962](image-20230424152311962.png)will turn to ![image-20230424152340613](image-20230424152340613.png)

If you select a Tariff in error, you can remove the Tariff by clicking on the ![image-20230424152347017](image-20230424152347017.png)and the Tariff will be removed from the Included Tariff list.

![order type tariff 3](order%20type%20tariff%203.png)

Continue to work through all of your Tariff categories, adding any Tariffs required for your Order Type.

## Adding Custom Data Capture to an Order Type

Some Order Types may require some additional data to be captured when raising an order.  If your Order Type does not require additional data simply leave this empty.

You have a list of input formats, such as *Text*, *Numbers* through to *Checkboxes*.

![order type custom data](order%20type%20custom%20data.png)

To add a data capture, click on the ![image-20230424152645426](image-20230424152645426.png)

Give your data capture a name - this is how it will appear in your Order page.

Tick the *Required* box if this data capture is mandatory, leave unticked if it is optional.

![order type custom data 2](order%20type%20custom%20data%202.png)

Then click *Save*.

Your capture field will appear on the right hand side, in the order they will appear on the Order Page.

To edit any of your data capture fields, click on the ![image-20230424152910731](image-20230424152910731.png)

To remove a capture field, click on ![image-20230424152829034](image-20230424152829034.png)

To change the order in which they will appear, click & hold the ![image-20230424152950610](image-20230424152950610.png)and drag it to the preferred order.

![order type custom data 3](order%20type%20custom%20data%203.png)

This is how they might appear in the Order Page.

![order type custom data order view](order%20type%20custom%20data%20order%20view.png)



## Adding an Agreement, Declaration or Signature to an Order Type

There may be some Order Types where you need to insert an Agreement or Declaration and capture a customer signature on the Order, such as Fuel or Orders with Contracts or Terms and Conditions.

?> For full instructions and a video about adding Agreements click [here](Agreements/Agreements)



## Editing Order Types

From the *Home* page, select *Administration*.

![image-20220711145443485](image-20220711145443485.png)

Then select *Order Types*.

![image-20220711145538974](image-20220711145538974.png)



Click on the name of the Order Type you wish to amend to open the details.

![image-20220711145716414](image-20220711145716414.png)



After the initial set up of Order Types there should be very little need to amend any of the details within the *info* tab of the Order Types.

You can add or edit the description in the *Guidelines* box - this is what users see when they are selecting the Order Type.  A detailed, accurate description in here will help users make the correct Order Type selection and avoid incorrect orders being raised.

If necessary, you can upload an invoice template or receipt that is bespoke to this particular Order Type.

Order Types can be sorted so that when you create a new order the most used Order Type appears at the top of the list and so on.

In the Sort column, click and hold on the icon to drag the Order Type to the desired position.
