The *Site* screen shows all the details relating to that site.  

Contact details (address, phone number and email) and payment details (bank account number, sort code etc), can be amended here.  These are the details that will be used to merge onto Orders and Receipts etc, so it is important they are kept up to date.

The Order Types that can be raised for that site can also be enabled or disabled from this screen, and the Pricebook that is used for the site can be set.
