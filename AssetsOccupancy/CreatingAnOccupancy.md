# Creating an Occupancy

You can create an Occupancy from a number of different areas within Harbour Assist.

You can create an Occupancy on the day of arrival, or to pre-book a Berth you can create an Occupancy in advance.

Each option has a slightly different sequence. There isn't a right or a wrong way, they all create an Occupancy, it is a case of simply choosing the right option for you.

## Creating an Occupancy from a Boat

In the Boat Page, go to the Tariff & Occupancy tab.

![image-20230619161649628](image-20230619161649628.png)

Next, click on the New Occupancy button and select the Occupancy Type from the drop-down list.

![image-20230619161929520](image-20230619161929520.png)

This will open a new window where you can confirm the details of your Occupancy.

Because you are creating an Occupancy through the Customer Account/Boat, the system already knows:

- What type of Occupancy it will be.

- Who the customer is
- Which boat they will be using (single boat owner). If the customer has more than one Boat, you can change the boat by clicking on the Boat name and selecting another boat.

Now you need to confirm their expected Arrival and Departure dates.

Use the **+/-** buttons for selecting a few days close by, or for longer date ranges, use the calendar pickers.

![image-20230619163507373](image-20230619163507373.png)

You have now confirmed who the Customer/Account is, which Boat they will be using, the type of Occupancy and their expected Arrival & Departure dates.

You now have two options.

To create an Occupancy without confirming a Berth/Asset (assigning a Berth/Asset on arrival), click *Save*.

To create an Occupancy reserving a Berth/Asset prior to their arrival, click on *Move*

This will open a list of your Assets. Use the filters to identify a suitable Asset.

When you find a suitable Asset, click on *Use*.
