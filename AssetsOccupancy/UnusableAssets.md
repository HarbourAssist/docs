# Unusable Assets #

Some Assets might be classed as *Unusable*, for example plant and equipment which are just in the system for inspection purposes, or an Asset might unusable while it is undergoing maintenance and repair. Unusable Assets are unsellable Assets, either permanently or temporarily.

To make an Asset Unusable, from the Home Page, go to *Asset Tools*.

Select *Asset* List from the drop-down options.

Return to your Asset List. 

By Default, Unusable Assets do not show in the Asset List. To make Unusable Assets visible, tick the box **Include Unusable**.

The Asset List will now display both Usable and Unusable Assets together.

Where an Asset may have been undergoing maintenance and repair, and is now ready to use, you can revert the Asset back to usable simply by un-checking the Unusable box in the Asset Details, and the screen will turn white indicating this Asset is now usable.
