# Occupancy Calendar #

The Occupancy Calendar assists users to carry out checks to ensure that all craft within the marina are either on a long term mooring contract or paying for visitor moorings.

Craft can be moved location by using this function, thus ensuring the system is always up to date with factual occupancy information and shows which berths/moorings are occupied or vacant.

From the *Home* page select **Occupancy**.

## Finding your way around the Occupancy view  ##

The Occupancy view can be filtered in many ways to aid you in finding the information you require.

Multi-site operators should firstly select the site you wish to view by using the drop down arrow next to the *Site* title.  

You can view the Occupancy by 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks or a month by selecting the view on the right hand side of the screen.

To move to the next 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks or a month, use the arrow keys on the right hand side of the screen, or to move to a specific date use the Calendar icon to select the date.  You can return to todays' date by clicking on *Today*

![image-20220131132817053](image-20220131132817053.png)



You can then select a specific area of the site by clicking on the blue buttons  which outline the different Regions of the site.

The view below is filtered to show just the Car Park.

If you wish to remove the filter and return to seeing the whole of the site, just click on the Red filter icon.

![image-20220131133148251](image-20220131133148251.png)

Some of your Assets may have been classified as *Unusable* - ie. it is not available for Occupancy, if you wish these to show on the Occupancy screen you need to check the *Include Unusable* box.  These Assets will then appear in a shaded red colour.

![image-20220131133959696](image-20220131133959696.png)

The Assets that are occupied will show an occupancy line - the colour of these lines will vary depending on the type of occupancy i.e. Residential, Leisure, Visitor etc., so at a glance you can see the type of occupancy on that mooring/berth. 

Within the occupancy line the text gives the name of the Account holder, the Boat that the occupancy relates to and the duration of the occupancy.

?> NB: For short occupancy periods not all the above information will show in the occupancy line due to space limitations - it will however show if you hover over the line with your cursor.

The column in between the Asset names and the calendar shows who the mooring/berth is licenced to. 

?> More documentation [here](Renewals/Licensing.md).

When an occupancy is associated with an Order you will also see within the occupancy line the status of the Order - C for confirmed, D for draft - and whether there is an outstanding balance on that order.  If the Order has been paid you will see a Â£0 balance in green, for outstanding balances the amount will show in red.

## Recording Occupancy Inspections

To record whether a craft is on its berth/mooring at a specific moment in time, click on the occupancy line of the craft and check the boat either IN or OUT as appropriate.

![image-20220131135322330](image-20220131135322330.png)

You will be asked to confirm your entry.

![image-20220131135356572](image-20220131135356572.png)

An 'eye' icon will appear on the occupancy line to indicate that boat has been checked In or Out - useful if you are walking up and down pontoons with an ipad!

![image-20220131135519729](image-20220131135519729.png)



This action of checking a boat IN or OUT is recorded within the *Boat Details* screen under the *Inspections* tab.  

![image-20220131135650786](image-20220131135650786.png)

To view details of the Inspections, click on the tab - you will be able to see the date/times of Inspections, who carried out the check, which Asset (mooring/berth) the craft was on and whether it was IN or OUT.

## Moving Boats ##

### Performing a One Way move ###

To move a boat to a vacant Asset from within the Occupancy screen, firstly click on the occupancy line you wish to move and select *Move/Split/Swap*.

You also have the option to add some notes stating why the occupancy has been moved if you wish.

Then click on *Next*.

The boat you are moving will be highlighted in light green.

You now need to find the Asset that the craft is moving to - you can filter down your options by using the Blue Tiles at the top of the screen if you wish, but in the example below I have selected to move it to C10.  You select the Asset that the craft is moving to by clicking on the *Use* button.

![image-20220210091254681](image-20220210091254681.png)

As this Asset is currently empty, the screen will automatically default to a *One Way* move.

You can select whether or not to move the License of the craft to the new location.

?> For more documentation about Licensing click [here](Renewals/Licensing.md). 

Click on *Perform Move*.

You will be prompted to confirm the more - click on OK.

![image-20220210091408498](image-20220210091408498.png)

Back in the Occupancy screen, you will see the craft has moved.  The occupancy on the old Asset is showing as departed and faded.

?> NB. The License move will not immediately show in the Occupancy Screen unless you ctrl+F5 to refresh.

![image-20220210091532418](image-20220210091532418.png)

?> NB. You can move a craft onto an occupied asset in exactly the same way - however only one craft can be licenced to the Asset - if you select to licence the moving craft onto the Asset a warning will appear and the existing craft will be unlicensed from the Asset.
