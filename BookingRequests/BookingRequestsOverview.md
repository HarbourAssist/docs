# Booking Requests Overview

Customers can now book your services online straight into Harbour Assist either via a widget on your website or via their Customer Portal.  Services offered are not restricted to Visitor/Transient Stays, customers can book any service; Boat Lifts, Boat Cleans, Marina Tours, the list is endless.  

If customers book via their Portal, they won't have to re-enter their personal or boat details, saving time and hassle. Another good reason to encourage use of the Portal!

Harbour Assist users can also book customers in using the same journey, via the Features tile on the homepage.

### Booking Request Profiles ###

We have provided an interface to allow administrators to configure the services your Marina/Organisation offers.  These allow you to configure:

- Name/image etc.
- Whether customers can book this via your website.
- Your standard capacity - how many *Slots* are available per day of the week.
- Which days your standard capacity differs - eg. Bank holidays, tidal impacts or staff holidays.
- What communications should go to the customer at each stage of the booking.  eg. when the book, you confirm, you cancel the booking etc.
- Link a Quick Order Template to a Booking Request Profile, enabling the customer to both book and pay for their order. 
- Whether a Task should be created and who it should be assigned to etc.
- Any custom CSS (this will make sense to your website team) that should be applied when embedded on your website.

Once configured, we provide the instructions for embedding on your website.
