# Create a Booking Request via Harbour Assist

One of the ways to create a Booking Request is via the system, where users can create a Request on behalf of a customer.  Whether this is available or not is configured against each Booking Request Profile when they are created.

?> For more documentation about creating a Booking Request Profile click [here](BookingRequests/CreatingProfile.md).

To create a Booking Request on behalf of a customer, from *Features* on the *Home* page select *Make a Booking*.
