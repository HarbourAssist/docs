When viewing the Booking Request you will see all the information completed by the customer.  From this screen you can click through to the Task to schedule a time for requests such as Lift Outs.

?> NB: Tasks that are created by a Booking Request will always default to the time of 00:00.  Click through to the task to schedule a time for the Request.

Once you have checked to see if you can accommodate the Request you can use the *Change Status* function to either confirm or cancel the Request.

You can also *Reschedule* the request to a different date.

Here you can filter by Request Type, Request Status, Site and Request Start Date.  

Joe in the yard is only interested in Lift Out requests, so he could filter to just show those.
