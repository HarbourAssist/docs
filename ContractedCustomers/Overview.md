# Overview

A contracted customer is someone who does repeated business with you, rather than a one off visitor for instance.

These customers and their boats need to be set up in the correct manner to ensure that when you carry out a Batch Renewal Run they are automatically included in the relevant Batch.

In order for the Renewal engine to work successfully certain data is required to be 'attached' to a craft:-

-  License
-  Allocated Tariff
-  Renewal Group

This information will form the basis of the Invoice and Occupancy that will be created.

Follow the detailed instructions in the rest of this *Contracted Customers* section to learn how to set up your Contracted Customers.
