# Logging Out #

It is good practice to log out of the Harbour Assist Programme at the end of the working day - to do this select the drop down arrow at the top of the screen, next to your log in name.

This will take you back to the Log In screen.

## Sliding Session Expiration ##

Harbour Assist has a 'Sliding Session Expiration' which means you'll remain logged in as long as you are using the application. After 1 hour of inactivity, you will be automatically logged out and reverted to the login page. When you log back in, you'll go back to the page you were at.
