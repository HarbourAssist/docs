You will be prompted with the following:

- Whether to create a Custom Schedule.

?> This requires the "InstalmentCustomSchedules" permission.  If you don't have this permission you won't see this option.

- Which Instalment Plan to use when generating the Schedule.  This will determine the number of months over which the value is split.

- The Pricebook to use.  This will determine the value of Schedule.

- Which month to start the Schedule from.

When you have completed this, click on *Next*.  You will be taken to the page where you can add Tariffs and see how the Value is calculated.

- Click on *Add Tariff*.  A pop-up will appear allowing you to choose the Tariffs.

?> NB: Only Tariffs configured to be availble to the chosen Instalment Plan will be availble.  Tariffs which aren't available in the selected Pricebook will be shown crossed-out.

-  Add the appropriate Tariffs.
- Click on *Done*.

The Schedule screen will show the total value of the Schedule and how this breaks down on a per-month basis.  At this point, the Schedule isn't saved, it's in a "Proposed" State.  Whilst in this State, Tariffs can be added, Occupancy dates modified etc.  Once you are happy with the payment schedule, click on *Commit*.

?> Once *Committed* an Instalment Schedule cannot be edited, it would need to be Credited out, so please be sure the schedule is correct.
