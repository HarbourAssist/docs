# Components

Some Assets have specialist parts or components that require inspection or maintenance.

You can add components to specific Assets, and they can be incorporated into the Inspection Regimes as part of your Maintenance Schedules.

For example, you might have two lawnmowers, one petrol and one electric. The electric lawnmower will have the added component of a cable that requires checking, whereas the petrol lawnmower does not. You can use the same Inspection Regime to check both lawnmowers, however the cable will only show as a specific component for the electric lawnmower.

## Adding a new Component

To add a new Component, from the Home Page go to *Asset Tools*, and from the drop-down list select *Asset Component Setup*.

## Adding the Inspection Regime to an Asset

Once your Component has been created, added to your Inspection Regime and added to your Asset, you will need to make sure that Asset is set up on the correct Inspection Regime.

On the Asset page, go into the *Details* tab, scroll down and check the Inspection Regime assigned to the Asset.

To change the Regime, click on the box and select from the drop-down list.

When you complete an Inspection for this Asset, the Component check will appear.

Using the same Inspection Regime for an Asset without the Component, the check will not appear on the Inspection.
