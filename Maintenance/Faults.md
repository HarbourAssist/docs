# Faults #

Harbour Assist provides tools to allow you to log Faults against Assets, and tools to manage these through to resolution.  Logging a Fault can be done at any time on an Asset - you don't have to be carrying out an Inspection.

To instruction about logging a Fault as part of an Inspection please click below.

?> More documentation [here](Maintenance/PerformingAnInspection.md).

## Logging a Fault ##

To log a fault on an Asset, from the *Home* page select *Asset Tools*.

You now need to find that Asset that needs a fault logging against it - remember to check the *Include Unusable* box to show all Assets and then filter the screen using the blue filter tiles.

Once you have found your Asset, you can open this Asset by either clicking on the Asset name or by selecting *View/Edit* in the green *Actions* box.
