## Inspections and Faults Views

The map can display details of inspections and faults against Assets.  Using these views, you can click through to carry out inspections or mark faults as rectified. 

Assets which are just on the system for inspection purposes such as plant, equipment and buildings are normally marked as Unusable Assets.  When selecting the Inspections or Faults view of the map, these will be included by default.

The Legend will also automatically update to reflect the view of the map you are on.
