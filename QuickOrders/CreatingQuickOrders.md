# Quick Orders

## Overview

Quick Orders have been developed to speed up the order creation process for the most popular purchases.

They are created via an order template with defined tariffs (either mandatory or optional) and can be used independently or as part of the Booking Requests process.  

For example – if you sell laundry tokens, you could have a ‘Laundry’ Quick Order Template which when selected automatically creates an order with the tariffs of Washer Tokens and Dryer Tokens, then the User only needs to enter the quantity.

When used in conjunction with Booking Requests, this will enable customers to both book and pay for services in one transaction.

?> More information on Booking Requests can be found  [here](BookingRequests/BookingRequestsOverview.md)
