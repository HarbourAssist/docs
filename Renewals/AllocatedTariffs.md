# Allocating Tariffs #

## Overview

In order for the Renewal engine to work correctly each boat requiring a recurring contract that will be part of an Batch Renewal Run needs to be Licensed to an Asset, have one or more Tariffs allocated to it and be assigned to a Renewal Group. 

?> For more documentation about Licensing click [here](Renewals/Licensing).

?> For more documentation about Renewal Groups click [here](Renewals/RenewalGroups).

The Batch Renewal Run will automatically charge the amount of the Tariff(s) that are allocated to the boat.

It is best to allocate the Tariff(s) to a boat at the point of setting up the account and boat details.

## Adding Tariffs to a Boat

To add a Tariff to a boat, from the Dashboard screen select the boat by clicking on the boat name or using the *Boats* tab.

Once you have selected the Tariffs, click *Save*.
