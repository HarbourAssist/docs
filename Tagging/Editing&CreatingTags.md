Then click on ***Tags***

![image-20220311120305336](image-20220311120305336.png)

This shows you a list of your current Tags.

Over time, the number of Tags you create will increase, so the advice would be to check current Tags to avoid duplication.

?> For information on how to ***Review Existing Tags*** click [here](Tagging/ReviewExistingTags.md)

![image-20220311120905233](image-20220311120905233.png)

Populate the fields to create a New Tag:

1. **Record Type (required field)** - select the record type you want your Tag to be attached to. 

2. **Label (required field)** - Name your Tag something simple but relevant to the subject.

3. **Select an icon** - you can use the search facility to find a suitable icon by clicking on **Select Icon** & entering a key word

4. **Animation** - select an animation from the drop down list

   ?> NB: Animations might be best used for urgent information such as Health & Safety to help them stand out and catch the Users attention

5. **Guidelines** - you can add notes on how the Tag should be applied as a guide for other Users

6. **Foreground Colour** - this will determine the text colour, best used in conjunction with the *Background Colour* & *Preview* so the text can be seen clearly

7. **Background Colour** - this will determine the main colour of the Tag, use in conjunction with the *Foreground Colour* & *Preview* (as above)

8. **Preview** - this will automatically populate how your Tag will look, so you can make necessary changes before saving
