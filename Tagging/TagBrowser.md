Tag Browser works in a similar way to a Smart List, as long as Tags have been applied correctly, you can use the Tag Browser to track, record and report on a variety of areas.

From the Home Screen, go to ***Smart Lists & Tagging***

Select **Tag Browser** from the drop down list.

Tag Browser shows a list of Tags for each Record Type selected from the drop down list.

#### ***Tags to Include***

Select the Record Type you need to review, in this example, I want to view **all** Boats without an Insurance Certificate on record.

To do this, tick the box in the ***Tags to Include*** section. (We will look at the *Tags But Not...* section shortly).

The search returns a list of all Boats that have been Tagged as currently missing Insurance Certificates.

#### ***Tags But Not...***

When browsing Tags, you may want to filter results to exclude additional criteria.

Using ***Tags to Include***, the search returned all boats without an Insurance Certificate, however, it included Commercial & Charter Boats. 

To exclude these from the search, use the ***Tags But Not***... section by ticking the criteria you wish to exclude from your search

Now you can see the search has returned all boats Awaiting Insurance Certificate - excluding Commercial & Charter Boats.
