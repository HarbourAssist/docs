# Overview

Sometimes you need to know when a customer is a VIP, or if a boat has dangerous goods on board, like pyrotechnics or bottled gas. Or share with colleagues that a mooring must be kept clear for the day.

You want to add the digital equivalent of a sticky note or highlighter pen to make these customers, boats or berths more quickly identifiable â€“ and this is what tagging can deliver. 

Tags are versatile and can be used across a broad range of record types within Harbour Assist - Accounts, Boats, Assets, Documents, Occupancies, Estimates, Communications, Meter Readings, Orders, Payments, Tariffs, Tasks and Waiting Lists.
