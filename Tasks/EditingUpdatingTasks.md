# Editing and Updating Tasks

Once a Task is created, it's important to keep it up to date so that other users who view the Task can see the whole picture.  This can be done by adding Notes to the Task, reassigning the Task to a different user or team, and re-scheduling the Task as necessary.

?> NB: The Permission of TaskEdit is required to be able to edit a Task.

## Adding a Note to a Task

It is useful to add Notes to a Task; this could be to inform other users you are dealing with the task or inform the user the Task has been assigned to that there has been an update i.e. the customer called again etc.

Any User with the Permission of TaskEdit can add a note to any Task.

Within the Task, click on the *Notes* tab.

Add the detail to the text box, then click on *Save New Note*.

?> NB: There is no need to enter the date, time or who is adding the note in the text box as this will be added automatically when you save the note.
