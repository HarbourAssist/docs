# Overview

Tasks are a 'job, instruction or action' and can be related to any item on Harbour Assist (Boat, Account, Asset or Order) or can be a standalone Task that isn't directly related to anything on the system.  They can be used to ask an individual User or a Team to contact the account holder, make changes to an Account or Order, carry out maintenance to an Asset, to alert a user of a  problem with an Asset that requires repair etc. They are assigned to a User or a Team and are tracked through to completion. 

Viewing the tasks of a User or Team can help with workload management - you can see what they need to do on a daily basis via an outlook-style calendar.  

Some Tasks will be created automatically, for instance when an email bounces a Task will be created on the relevant account and assigned to a pre-defined Team so that they can follow it up with the customer. 

To aid Task monitoring and analysis each Task is given a Task Type.  Additional Task Types can be created in the Administration part of the system.
