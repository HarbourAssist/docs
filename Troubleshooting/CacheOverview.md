# Cache Overview

### What is Cache?

Cache collects temporary data to help websites, browsers, and apps load faster. Whether it's a computer, laptop or phone, web browser or app, you'll find some variety of a cache. A cache makes it easy to quickly retrieve data, which in turn helps devices run faster.

Depending on the device you are using, there are two types of Cache used to access and use Harbour Assist. 

Mac/iOS devices use Safari Cache, Windows/Android use Google Chrome Cache.

### Why do I need to clear my cache?

Where Users (Harbour Assist) or customers (Customer Portal) are having issues signing in or using the system we commonly advise clearing your cache.

Because cache stores information on the system, if the system has changed, such as an update, the information stored in the cache becomes obsolete, as a result, the cache is confusing your device causing issues with signing in and  using the system.

Think of it a bit like a Sat Nav, you program the Sat Nav to guide you to your destination using the routes pre-loaded on the navigation device. However, if the route includes a new road layout - the Sat Nav will become confused. To cure the problem, you would need to update the device to include up to date maps.
