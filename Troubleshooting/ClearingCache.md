# Clear Cache Extension #

In order for the system to work effectively, particularly after a new release to the system, it may be necessary to clear the Cache in Chrome.  

By following the instructions below you can set this up so that the Cache can be cleared with a single click.

First, click on the *Customise and Control Google Chrome* button which can be found at the top of the screen when you have Chrome open.
