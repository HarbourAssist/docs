# Guidance Tips

To help you find your way around Harbour Assist we have some *Guidance Tips*, these tips will automatically be displayed as new ones are added and if you wish to revisit any tips you can hit the info button at the top of the screen.

?> NB. The info button will be hidden if you are on a page that has no tips.

When a *Guidance Tip* is displayed the rest of the screen will be faded out to highlight the tip.  After reading you can *Hide page tips* or click on *Next* to see the next tip on that page.
