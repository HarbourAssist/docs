<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/GeneralNavigation/img/Homescreen.png" alt="Query Editor" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<h2 id="findingacustomer">Finding a Customer</h2>
<p>To find an existing customer or to check if someone already has an account (live or archived) - from the <em>Home</em> page, enter a significant word in the <em>Enter search term</em> box - this would normally be a surname, but could also be a first name, boat name, email address or postcode.  You can also search by Account ID or Order ID.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/GeneralNavigation/img/Findingacustomer1.png" alt="Query Editor" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>All the customers that match your search will be shown, giving details of their name, boat, account number, address - this will enable you to confidently select the correct customer.  Archived accounts will show in RED and archived boats that are on live accounts will show the boat name in RED.  </p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/GeneralNavigation/img/Findingacustomer2.png" alt="Query Editor" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Move your cursor to the customer you wish to select - it will highlight the customer in blue - and click.  This will take you to the customer dashboard.</p>

<p>?&gt; NB: The search is set to default to a General search, but to narrow the results you can use the drop down key to change this to a more specific search.  Different search types will show different details in the results - for instance the search type of Boat will show the boat dimensions and a picture of the boat (if one has been uploaded) in the results.</p>

<h2 id="explainingaccounttypes">Explaining Account Types</h2>
<p>Account records in Harbour Assist represent people, businesses or organisations that you <em>currently, might</em> or <em>did</em> do business with or have a relationship with.  Account records are each assigned an <strong>Account Type</strong> via a dropdown.</p>
<p>?&gt; NB. an Account record can only have a single Account Type and this will be the <em>primary</em> use of the Account. </p>
<p><strong>Account Types</strong> would typically include <em>Leisure, Residential, Visitor, Commercial, Boat Yard</em>, but can be specifically set and modified to suit each business using the Harbour Assist system.</p>
<p>If you need any new Account Types adding please contact us by raising a help ticket from within Harbour Assist <img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200512131407022.png" alt="image-20200512131407022" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<h2 id="viewinganaccount">Viewing an Account</h2>
<p>Once you have found your account you can see at a glance the main detail of the account in the account header box at the top of the screen.  This shows which site the account is for, the account type, gives an overview of the account balance, highlighting if any money is owed and shows who created the account and when.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191212154734096.png" alt="image-20191212154734096" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>You can navigate around the account using the tabs to find order details, boat details, communications with the customer, tasks that have been set relating to the account, documents relating to the account and details of any waiting list the account is on.</p>

<p>Before creating any new account, you should first check the customer does not already have an account by following the <strong>Finding a Customer</strong> process noted in the <strong>Home Page Layout</strong> section.  </p>
<p>?&gt; More documentation <a href="GeneralNavigation/HomepageLayout">here</a>.</p>
<p>This is to avoid duplicate accounts being set up.</p>
<p>From the <strong>HOME</strong> page, click on the new account button.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/img/Creatinganaccount1.png" alt="Query Editor" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>This will take you to the <strong>Enter Account and Boat Details</strong> page.  Firstly select the correct Site and Account Type by using the drop down keys, then enter as much customer and boat information as is available.  Use the <em>Postcode Search</em> facility to ensure an accurate address is entered.  Click on <em>Save and View Account</em> when you have finished.</p>
<p>?&gt; NB: Accounts can be set up without a boat, just don't enter any information at all in the boat details part of the screen.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/img/Creatinganaccount2.png" alt="Query Editor" class="img-thumbnail"></p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Lead Accounts are a way of tracking all enquiries received and conversion rates.  </p>
<p>Lead Accounts differ slightly from any other Account Type, as you cannot raise an Order on a Lead Account.  You can raise an Estimate or add the Account/Boat to any Waiting Lists.</p>
<p>?&gt; More documentation on Estimates can be found <a href="AccountsOrdersPayments/Estimates.md">here</a></p>
<p>?&gt; More documentation on Waiting Lists can be found <a href="AssetsOccupancy/WaitingLists.md">here</a></p>
<p>When setting up a Lead Account some additional information is required to be completed (Lead Source and Primary Interest), this is so that enquiry and conversation analysis can be carried out.</p>
<p>You can configure your own Lead Source and Primary Interest dropdown lists in Lookups.  For instance if you attend an annual boat show you could set up a Lead Source of Boat Show 2020 - this would capture how many Leads were received at the show and subsequently how many of those were converted to customers.</p>
<p>?&gt; More documentation on Lookups can be found <a href="Administration/Lookups.md">here</a></p>

<p>Clicking the ‘Checkout’ button will take the customer onto the payment screen. </p>
<p>?&gt; NB. Paysafe only</p>
<p>Each time a customer enters their card details, they will have the option to <strong>save that card</strong> for future use, very similar to storing cards when using Amazon. The next time they pay via the Portal then can use the saved card or select ‘pay with new card’. Storing cards makes paying via the Portal quicker and easier for your customers, especially if they are using mobile devices – it takes away the risk of entering numbers incorrectly and having to start again!</p>
<p>Rest assured these card details will not be accessible by anyone other than the customer ie. Users cannot access this detail if they view a customer’s portal, and the detail is held securely by Paysafe and not within Harbour Assist. A customer can of course choose not to save their card details if they wish.</p>

<h2 id="quickpay">Quick Pay</h2>
<p>Not all customers want to register on our portal to pay their bill. We now support “quick pay” links which allow a customer to pay for an Order without registering nor logging into the portal.</p>
<p>Not only do customers not have to log in, they can use the same Vaulted Cards (as long as they know their CV2 number) as they do on the portal.</p>
<p>This link is embedded into our default email order template, along with a nice, friendly <strong>Pay Now</strong> button. <em>If you have customised your invoice email, let us know and we’ll inject it for you</em>.</p>
<p>We have also integrated Quick-Pay into a “SMS Invoice” feature, to streamline visitor operations. We timed it and with a vaulted card, visitors can pay within 30 seconds of receiving their invoice SMS.</p>
<ol>
<li>Customer receives SMS with quick-pay link.</li>
<li>Customer either uses vaulted card or enters new card.</li>
<li>Customer clicks on “Pay”.</li>

<p>A contracted customer is someone who does repeated business with you, rather than a one off visitor for instance.</p>
<p>These customers and their boats need to be set up in the correct manner to ensure that when you carry out a Batch Renewal Run they are automatically included in the relevant Batch.</p>
<p>In order for the Renewal engine to work successfully certain data is required to be 'attached' to a craft:-</p>
<ul>
<li>License</li>
<li>Allocated Tariff</li>
<li>Renewal Group</li>
</ul>
<p>This information will form the basis of the Invoice and Occupancy that will be created.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In order for the Renewal engine to work correctly each boat requiring a recurring contract that will be part of an Batch Renewal Run needs to be Licensed to an Asset, have one or more Tariffs allocated to it and be assigned to a Renewal Group.</p>

<p>?&gt; For more documentation about Renewal Groups click <a href="Renewals/RenewalGroups.md">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Batch Renewal Run will automatically create an Occupancy against the Asset that the boat is Licensed to for the specified dates of the Batch Renewal Run.</p>
<p>Each Asset can only have 1 boat licensed to it, however a boat can be licensed to more than one asset.  For example, if a boat is taking up 2 berths it could be licensed to both.</p>
<p>It is best to License a boat to an Asset at the point of setting up the account and boat details.</p>
<h2 id="addingalicensetoaboat">Adding a License to a Boat</h2>

<p>Most marinas/harbours require customers to give a notice period, so you will need to record their intention to leave (or not renew) on Harbour Assist.  There are a couple of ways that you can do this:-</p>
<ul>
<li>The creation a <strong>Task</strong> on the Account - you could have a specific Task Type for this.  You would set the Task to the relevant User or Team for the date of departure so that it appeared in their Task notifications at the appropriate time.  They could then carry out all the actions required at the departure date (see below for suggested actions).</li>
<li>Manage leavers by <strong>Renewal Group</strong> - you could set up Renewal Groups called Non-Renewal, Leaver end of March, Leaver end of June etc depending on your contract periods ie. are they all annual from 1st April, or could they start at any point in the year.  The names of the Renewal Groups are entirely up to you and these can be set up in Lookups.  When the customer notifies you they are leaving, set the Renewal Group on the boat to the appropriate 'leaving' one.  You can identify all boats in that Renewal Group by the creation of a Smart List.  By viewing the Smart List you can then carry out all the actions required for each boat/account at their departure date (see below for suggested actions).</li>
</ul>
<p>?&gt; More documentation on Lookups can be found <a href="Administration/Lookups.md">here</a></p>
<h2 id="suggestedactionsforleavers">Suggested actions for Leavers</h2>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>If a customer enquires about "how much will it cost for …..?", you should create an Estimate, which can if/when the Customer decides to take it up, be converted into a Draft Order.  Estimates have the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are valid for a configurable number of days.  Once expired, they cannot be converted to a Draft Order.</li>
<li>Expired Estimates can be "Regenerated" to a new Estimate, which will pick up any changes in pricing.</li>
<li>Estimates can be emailed to Customers, and the email body can be edited.</li>
</ul>
<p>?&gt; NB: If you have not used Estimates before and cannot see the Estimates tab and button please just submit a help ticket and we can enable the feature for you.</p>
<h2 id="viewingandcreatingestimates">Viewing and Creating Estimates</h2>
<p>Created Estimates are stored on an account in the same way that orders are.  To view any created Estimates just click on the Estimates tab on the account.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200707134703309.png" alt="image-20200707134703309" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200707134740198.png" alt="image-20200707134740198" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>To create a new Estimate, click on the green Estimate button.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200707134819835.png" alt="image-20200707134819835" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>If the Estimate is for a product that has a time duration ie. a berthing contact, select the start date and departure date using the calendar pickers.  For non-duration products, such as a boat lift, just leave these blank.</p>
<p>Enter an expiry date for the Estimate if you wish to override the default expiry date, then click <em>Save</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200707134910061.png" alt="image-20200707134910061" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Now you can add your tariffs by clicking on the <em>+ Add tariffs</em> button.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200707135005930.png" alt="image-20200707135005930" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>All tariffs in your pricebook will show, so if you need to filter these down to make it easier to find the correct one, please use the tariff category filters at the top of the list.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200707135431838.png" alt="image-20200707135431838" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Select the quantity for the tariff(s) you want to add and then click on <em>Back to Estimate</em>.</p>
<p>?&gt; NB: Duration based tariffs (ie. per night/per day calculations) will calculate automatically based on the Start Date and Departure Date you have entered on the Estimate - the quantity of 1 should be selected in these cases.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200707135518279.png" alt="image-20200707135518279" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>You can optionally add any notes for the customer or a reference if you wish.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200707135621511.png" alt="image-20200707135621511" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>The Estimate is now ready to send to the customer.  Using the <em>PDF</em> button select Download to print or Email to send via email.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200707135751680.png" alt="image-20200707135751680" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>If you have selected Email a pop-up will appear where you can amend the cover email if you wish.  Once this is done click <em>Send</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200707135850967.png" alt="image-20200707135850967" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<h2 id="convertinganestimatetoanorder">Converting an Estimate to an Order</h2>
<p>If a customer confirms they wish to proceed based on the Estimate price, you can convert the Estimate to an Order.</p>
<p>From the Estimates tab, open up the Estimate by clicking on the Actions button and Edit.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200707140019919.png" alt="image-20200707140019919" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Click on the blue <em>Convert</em> button.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200707140100561.png" alt="image-20200707140100561" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Select the relevant Order Type from the list.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200707140202135.png" alt="image-20200707140202135" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>This has now converted the Estimate to a Draft Order.  As the Order is Draft you can still make any changes as necessary.</p>
<p>?&gt; NB: If your Estimate had the Start and Departure dates populated the same dates will populate on the Draft Order.  All you need to do is select the Asset by clicking on the red <em>Asset</em> button; just the same as when raising an order from scratch.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200707140249577.png" alt="image-20200707140249577" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Back in the Estimates tab, the Estimate status will now show as Converted.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200707140340858.png" alt="image-20200707140340858" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>If you open up the Estimate you can see details of the Order ID it has been converted to and you can also go straight through to the Order from here.</p>
<p>?&gt; NB: You are not able to make any changes to an Estimate once it has been converted.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200707140425078.png" alt="image-20200707140425078" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>The Order will show that it was created by being converted from an Estimate.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200707145238955.png" alt="image-20200707145238955" class="img-thumbnail"></p></body><br><hr/><head></head><body><h1 id="orders">Orders</h1>
<h2 id="explainingordertypes">Explaining Order Types</h2>
<p><strong>Order Types</strong> are a description of the goods or services that are being provided and purchased.</p>
<p>Once an Account is created with an <em>Account Type</em> (see below for more information) an Order can be raised.   Multiple orders with different <strong>Order Types</strong> can be raised for an Account.</p>
<p>?&gt; More documentation on Accounts can be found <a href="AccountsOrdersPayments/Accounts">here</a></p>
<p>Each Order is assigned a single <strong>Order Type</strong>, and the <strong>Order Type</strong> will determine:-</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Tariffs</em> available for composing the Order (see Tariffs and Pricebooks)</li>
<li>The Invoice/Receipt template format</li>
<li>Custom Order-level data capture.</li>
</ul>
<p>?&gt; More documentation on Tariffs and Pricebooks can be found <a href="AccountsOrdersPayments/TariffsPricebooks">here</a></p>
<p><strong>Order Types</strong> are bespoke to each business using the Harbour Assist system and can be set up using the <strong>Administration</strong> tile from the <strong>Home</strong> page.  See below for more information on setting <strong>Order Types</strong>. </p>
<p>?&gt; More documentation on Order Types can be found <a href="Administration/OrderTypes">here</a></p>
<h2 id="viewinganaccountsorderstab">Viewing an Accounts Orders Tab</h2>
<p>The <em>Orders</em> tab on an Account is where you will find all the accounts financial transactions.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200706161036770.png" alt="image-20200706161036770" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>The information contained within the Orders tab can be displayed in 2 different views; the Classic View or the History View, and it is personal preference which view you use.  When viewing the Orders tab Harbour Assist will remember the view that you last used and use that one by default.</p>
<p>You can select the different views by using the buttons on the right of the screen - the button of the currently selected view will display in a darker blue.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200706161531400.png" alt="image-20200706161531400" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<h3 id="classicview">Classic View</h3>
<p>This view will display transactions with Orders showing in the top part of the screen and Payments, credits &amp; refunds showing in the bottom part of the screen.  Each section of the screen is paginated if there are a large number of transactions.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200706162502853.png" alt="image-20200706162502853" class="img-thumbnail"></p>

<h3 id="historyview">History View</h3>
<p>The History View displays all transactions in date order with the most recent at the top.  Again, it is paginated on accounts where there are a large number of transactions.  This view has the added features of:-</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Balance</strong> - this gives you a running balance after each transaction,</li>
<li><strong>Filter</strong> - the ability to filter the screen to only show certain transactions,</li>
<li><strong>Download to Excel</strong> - download the accounts transactions to Excel so that you can analyse the data in more detail.</li>
</ul>
<p>?&gt; NB: Draft orders and credit notes will not be included in the Balance figures; a dash will be displayed if the transaction is not included.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200706163913865.png" alt="image-20200706163913865" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<h2 id="raisinganorder">Raising an Order</h2>
<p>To raise a new order, click on the <strong>Order</strong> button in the main toolbar on an Account.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191219143103283.png" alt="image-20191219143103283" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Alternatively, if you don't need to review the Account prior to raising an order, you can use the 'Quick Order' button that appears when you search for an Account.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191219143339301.png" alt="image-20191219143339301" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>When you select <strong>Order</strong> you then need to select the <strong>Order Type</strong> - a list of <strong>Order Types</strong> and descriptions are shown and you select the relevant one by clicking on the tile.</p>
<p>?&gt; NB: If you are a multi-site operator this is also where you can select which site the order needs to be raised for (this overrides the Site the Account is associated with).</p>
<p>?&gt; More information about Cross-site Orders can be found <a href="AccountsOrdersPayments/Orders?id=cross-site-orders-multi-site-operators-only.md">here</a></p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191219143530461.png" alt="image-20191219143530461" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>You will then be taken back to the <strong>Orders</strong> screen.  In the example we are raising an Order for a Residential mooring contract.  You can now select the contract period by choosing a start and end date (this will create the occupancy), attach the contract to an Asset and select the boat that the contract is for (if the Account has more than 1 boat on it).</p>
<p>At the top of the screen you can see details about the order.  At this stage the order is still in draft status (see <strong>Order Status</strong> below).</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191219151639807.png" alt="image-20191219151639807" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>You now need to select the Tariffs that make up the Order - this will determine the price</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191219151738459.png" alt="image-20191219151738459" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>The Tariff Selection page will show all Tariffs available for this Order Type.  You can remove this filter to view all tariffs or you can narrow this down by selecting the category of Tariffs (green tiles) that you wish to choose from.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191219152109389.png" alt="image-20191219152109389" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Select the Tariff which you wish to charge by clicking on the <em>Quantity</em> button - if your Tariff has been set up as a Length Overall Tariff (this is noted in the <em>Calc</em> column) the price will automatically be calculated using the price per metre and the length of the boat.</p>
<p>Once you are happy the correct price is being charged, select <em>Back to Order</em> at the top of the page.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191219152347171.png" alt="image-20191219152347171" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Your <strong>Order</strong> is now created in Draft status.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191219152500252.png" alt="image-20191219152500252" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>By clicking on the blue <em>Invoice</em> button you can download to print, email or SMS the order to the customer.</p>
<p>?&gt; More information about sending an order by SMS (Quick Pay) can be found <a href="AccountsOrdersPayments/CustomerPortal?id=quick-pay.md">here</a></p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200708142432171.png" alt="image-20200708142432171" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<h2 id="crosssiteordersmultisiteoperatorsonly">Cross-site Orders (Multi-site operators only)</h2>
<p>For multi-site operators it is inevitable that at some time a customer from one site will visit and potentially make purchases at another site.</p>
<p>To deal with this, you can choose which Site the order should be associated with and all revenue from the order will be attributed to the chosen Site.</p>
<p>When creating an order, if the Account is associated with different site to your own default site, at the top of the Order Types screen you will have the option to select which site you want to use.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200708101115113.png" alt="image-20200708101115113" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>When you select the site that the order needs to be associated with, only the Order Types that are available for use at that site will show.</p>
<p>Select the relevant Order Type to create the Order.</p>
<p>On the draft Order that it clearly says that a cross-site order has been created.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200708101526358.png" alt="image-20200708101526358" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>You can now continue to create the Order in the usual way.</p>
<p>When you add the tariffs to the Order, the tariffs displayed will be for the Site that the order is associated with.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200708101632855.png" alt="image-20200708101632855" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<h3 id="reportingoncrosssiteorders">Reporting on Cross-site Orders</h3>
<p>In the Reporting section, there is a Report that shows all Cross-site Orders.  From the <em>Home</em> screen click on <em>Reporting</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191223111112283.png" alt="image-20191223111112283" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Then select the Cross-Site Orders report.  The report has various filters that you can apply including setting a date range.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200708102604796.png" alt="image-20200708102604796" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<h2 id="orderstatus">Order Status</h2>
<p><strong>Proposed:</strong> An order shows in a <em>Proposed</em> status when created through a <em>Batch Run</em>.  This is the first stage of Batch Renewals and the order is fully editable at this stage.  A Proposed order will not show on the Customer Portal. More information on this can be found in the <strong>Renewals</strong> section.</p>
<p>?&gt; More documentation on Renewal Batches can be found <a href="Renewals/BatchRuns">here</a></p>
<p><strong>Draft:</strong> An order which is still editable, the 'Tax Point' has not been set, so line items can be added, removed, costs overridden etc. In this state, the Order will NOT appear on any accounting package export, but WILL affect the Account Balance and show on the Customer Portal.  It can therefore be paid via the Portal by the customer.</p>
<p><strong>Confirmed:</strong> This Status means that the order is locked and cannot be edited. An Order can be put into a Confirmed Status manually, or automatically goes to this state if any Payment is allocated against the Order. An unpaid Confirmed order will show on the Customer Portal.</p>
<h2 id="cloninganorder">Cloning an Order</h2>
<p>Harbour Assist provides the ability to clone an order; this could be particularly useful if you have a customer who buys the same service on a regular basis.  When an order is cloned, the cloned order is created in a Draft status, so you still have the option to make changes and amendments.</p>
<p>?&gt; NB: Beware if you are cloning an order that has an occupancy - all elements relating to the order including occupancy records will be cloned. This may make the Account look they are making multiple concurrent visits.</p>
<p>An order can be cloned by either clicking on the <em>Actions</em> button on the relevant order line and then <em>Clone</em>,</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200706153858914.png" alt="image-20200706153858914" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>or, </p>
<p>Using the <em>Clone</em> button from within the order you wish to clone.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200706154033350.png" alt="image-20200706154033350" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>You will be asked to confirm you wish to clone the order - select Yes if you wish to continue.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200706154504263.png" alt="image-20200706154504263" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>When you select Yes, you will be taken into the new draft order.  You can now make any amendments required.</p></body><br><hr/><head></head><body><h1 id="creditnotes">Credit Notes</h1>
<p>There are 2 ways to raise a credit note on an Account.  </p>
<h2 id="raisingacreditnoteviaanorder"><strong>Raising a Credit Note via an Order</strong></h2>
<p>If the credit note is directly associated with a confirmed order ie. you need to credit the entire or part of the order, you can raise the credit note by clicking on the Actions button on the Order line.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191220115344680.png" alt="image-20191220115344680" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Alternatively, if you are already viewing the Order, you can click on Credit.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191220115516734.png" alt="image-20191220115516734" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Both of these will take you to the same next screen.</p>
<p>Now you can choose which tariff lines to include in the Credit Note.  If you want to credit out the order in full just leave the <em>Include</em> boxes ticked on each line and click <strong>Credit</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191220121038610.png" alt="image-20191220121038610" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>To credit out just one (or some) of the tariff lines uncheck the <em>Include</em> box for any that do not require crediting, then click <strong>Credit</strong>.  In this example I only want to credit out the Laundry tokens.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191220121600648.png" alt="image-20191220121600648" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>You can also part credit an amount.  In the example below the customer was charged for 10 laundry tokens instead of 1 in error, I therefore want to credit out 9 of the laundry tokens (9 x £2.80 = £25.20). Just type the amount to be credited into the <em>Gross Total</em> box and then click <strong>Credit</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191220121854015.png" alt="image-20191220121854015" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>You have now created a draft Credit Note.  </p>
<p>Enter some detail into the <em>Notes</em> section explaining why a Credit Note is being issued.  This is good practice from an audit perspective.</p>
<p>Once you have ensured all the detail is correct click on Commit Credit.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191220122346681.png" alt="image-20191220122346681" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>You will be prompted to confirm the Credit. Click <strong>Yes</strong> to confirm this.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191220122617217.png" alt="image-20191220122617217" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>When the Credit Note is committed you will automatically be taken to the <em>Allocate Payments</em> page. </p>
<p>?&gt; NB. Even though the credit note was raised via an order it will not automatically be allocated to that order - this is to give users greater flexibility.</p>
<p>If the Credit Note has been raised in order to create a Refund, just click on Back to Account without making any allocations.  </p>
<p>?&gt; More documentation on Refunds can be found <a href="AccountsOrdersPayments/Refunds.md">here</a></p>
<h2 id="raisingacreditnoteviatools">Raising a Credit Note via Tools</h2>
<p>To raise a more general Credit Note where you can add tariffs manually it is best to use the <em>Tools</em> button.</p>
<p>Click on the <em>Tools</em> button in the toolbar at the top of the Account and select <em>Credit Note</em>.</p>

<p>You have now created a draft Credit Note.  </p>
<p>Enter some detail into the <em>Notes</em> section explaining why a Credit Note is being issued.  This is good practice from an audit perspective.</p>
<p>Then click on the <em>click to Add</em> button.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191220134654224.png" alt="image-20191220134654224" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>To add the Tariff that you want to use to create the credit amount, first select the tariff category and then select the tariff.  Once added you can, if necesssary, edit the tariff description to accurately describe the credit.   </p>
<p>Now you can enter the credit amount into the Gross Unit cell - there is no need to enter it as a negative value, the system will do this for you.</p>
<p>Check the details and then click <em>Commit Credit</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191220142713360.png" alt="image-20191220142713360" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>You will be prompted to confirm the Credit. Click <strong>Yes</strong> to confirm this.</p>

<p>When the Credit Note is committed you will automatically be taken to the <em>Allocate Payments</em> page. </p>
<p>If the Credit Note has been raised in order to create a Refund, just click on Back to Account without making any allocations.  </p>
<p>?&gt; More documentation on Refunds can be found <a href="AccountsOrdersPayments/Refunds.md">here</a></p>
<h2 id="allocatingacreditnote">Allocating a Credit Note</h2>
<p>To allocate the Credit Note, click anywhere on the Credit Note line to select the Credit.</p>
<p>You will now be able to see all outstanding Orders - select the Order you wish to allocate the Credit to by clicking on the <em>Allocate</em> button.  </p>

<p>?&gt; NB. If the Credit Note amount exceeds the Order amount, the remaining Credit amount will be left on the Account and be available to allocate to other Orders.  Select <em>Confirm</em> to allocate the Credit to the Order.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191220123843936.png" alt="image-20191220123843936" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>If the entire amount of the Credit Note has been allocated you will be notified there are no further funds available to allocate and should select <em>Back to Account</em>.</p>

<p>Harbour Assist has the facility for customers to be able to access their Account on-line and make payments, However, customers can only make full payment of an invoice on-line, they cannot part pay an invoice.</p>
<h2 id="takingapayment">Taking a Payment</h2>
<p>There are 3 ways to record and take a payment in Harbour Assist:-</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <em>Take Payment</em> button - This is normally used when the payment is for more than 1 order, or a payment is being taken on account ie. a deposit where no order is in place.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Actions</em> button on <em>Orders</em> page - This is used when the payment is for a particular Order.</p></li>
<li><p>From within the Order itself - This is used when the payment is for a particular Order and is most commonly used if the payment is being taken at the same time at the Order is being created.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="takepaymentbutton">Take Payment button</h3>
<p>This can be found in the Toolbar at the top of an Account.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191220151151933.png" alt="image-20191220151151933" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>If you access the <em>New Payment</em> screen from the <em>Take Payment</em> route, the <em>Amount</em> will default to the total outstanding amount of draft and confirmed orders on the Account.</p>
<p>?&gt; NB: It will not include any <em>Future Orders</em> that have been created as part of an Instalment Plan for example.  You can click on the toggle button to show future orders.</p>

<h3 id="usingtheactionsbuttonontheordersscreenorpaynowfromwithinanorder">Using the Actions Button on the Orders Screen or Pay Now from within an Order</h3>
<p>If you access the <em>New Payment</em> screen from either of these routes the <em>Amount</em> will default to the amount owing on that particular Order.</p>

<p>You still have the option to include other orders and to show future orders.</p>
<p>Whichever route you have used, once you are at the New Payment screen and the amount to be paid is showing, you follow the same process to take the payment.</p>
<p>First click on the appropriate payment method on the blue tiles at the top of the screen.  </p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191220155002488.png" alt="image-20191220155002488" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Depending on the payment method you may be prompted to enter a code, reference or cheque number etc. </p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191220155346088.png" alt="image-20191220155346088" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Complete this and then click <em>Save &amp; Pay</em>.</p>

<p>Now you have the option to either print or email a receipt to the customer.  There are 2 types of receipt - a Payment Receipt and an Order Receipt.  A Payment Receipt is a more generalised receipt, the Order Receipt gives more details of the Order that has been paid.  If a payment has been taken for more than 1 Order an Order Receipt will show for each individual Order (so in this case you may be better to use the Payment Receipt).  </p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191220162859056.png" alt="image-20191220162859056" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<h2 id="takingapartpaymentonanorder">Taking a Part Payment on an Order</h2>
<p>There may be times it is agreed a customer can part pay an order.  Part payments cannot be made by the customer using their on-line portal.</p>
<p>Access the <em>New Payment</em> screen by any of the 3 routes discribed above, then manually enter the amount that is being paid in to the <em>Amount</em> cell - you will need to overtype the auto populated amount.</p>
<p>The check the <em>Allocate</em> box for the order that the part payment is to be allocated against.  If it is for more than 1 order, check the <em>Allocate</em> box and enter the Allocation Amount into the <em>Allocation</em> cell for each order.</p>

<p>As the amount paid isn't paying an Order in full, the only receipt option is the Payment Receipt.  This can be printed or emailed to the customer.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191223110029428.png" alt="image-20191223110029428" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Clicking on <em>Back to Account</em> will take you to the <em>Orders</em> overview for the Account.  Here you will see the part payment against the Order.</p>

<h2 id="takingapaymentonanaccountwithoutanorder">Taking a Payment on an Account without an Order</h2>
<p>Payments can be taken without an Order being raised - a deposit, for example, that will then be allocated to an Order at a later date.</p>
<p>To take a payment that is not associated with an order, use the <em>Take Payments</em> button.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191220151151933.png" alt="image-20191220151151933" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Select the payment method, enter the amount being paid and then select <em>Save &amp; Pay</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191220164855339.png" alt="image-20191220164855339" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>As the amount paid isn't allocated to any Orders, the only receipt option is the Payment Receipt.  This can be printed or emailed to the customer.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191220165026141.png" alt="image-20191220165026141" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>The Account will show as being in credit by the amount paid, and the payment will be unallocated. </p>

<h2 id="usingthevirtualterminalphonepayments">Using the Virtual Terminal (phone payments)</h2>
<p>Using the Virtual Terminal to take card payments over the phone eliminates need for dual keying into a PDQ machine and then into Harbour Assist, thus minimising the risk of mistakes. </p>
<p>?&gt; NB:  The Virtual Terminal is only available when Paysafe is used as the payment provider.</p>
<p>Using the normal routes to take a payment, when at the New Payment screen, click <em>Virtual Terminal</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200520151642393.png" alt="image-20200520151642393" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Once you have ensured the payment amount and the order allocation is correct click on <em>Start Virtual Terminal Payment</em>. This will open the Virtual Terminal.</p>
<p>?&gt; NB: The minimum amount payable by VT is £1.00.</p>
<p>Now you can enter the card details. </p>
<p>The ‘Name on Card’ will default to the customers name as it appears on their Harbour Assist account – this can be changed if their name appears differently on their card.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200520151839634.png" alt="image-20200520151839634" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Once you have entered the card details click <em>Next</em>.</p>
<p>Now you need to enter the address that the card is registered to – again, this will default to the address as it appears on the customers Harbour Assist account – this can be changed if necessary.</p>
<p>?&gt; NB: Changing an address here will not update their Harbour Assist account address.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200520151947593.png" alt="image-20200520151947593" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>When the address has been entered click <em>Next</em>.</p>
<p>Customer can store their cards to make future payments quicker and easier (very similar to when you store a card on Amazon). Cards are stored within Paysafes Vaulted Card Storage and not within Harbour Assist, so they are 100% secure and the details cannot be accessed by Harbour Assist Users.</p>
<p>Ask the customer if they would like to store their card, then select <em>Yes</em> or <em>No</em> as appropriate.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200520152042250.png" alt="image-20200520152042250" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Finally, confirm with the customer the amount you are about to take a payment for and click on <em>Yes</em> to confirm or <em>No</em> to cancel the transaction.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200520152124945.png" alt="image-20200520152124945" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>If you clicked Yes to confirm the transaction, you will be taken to the normal Payment Confirmation page where you can email or print a receipt for the customer.</p>
<h3 id="storedcards">Stored Cards</h3>
<p>Customer can store their cards to make future payments quicker and easier (very similar to when you store a card on Amazon). Cards are stored within Paysafes Vaulted Card Storage and not within Harbour Assist, so they are 100% secure and the details cannot be accessed by Harbour Assist Users.</p>
<p>If a customer has already stored a card (either when they made a previous phone payment or they stored it themselves in their customer Portal), you will see the following options when taking a Virtual Terminal payment.</p>
<p>Select <em>Virtual Terminal</em> and then <em>Start Virtual Terminal Payment</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200520152250886.png" alt="image-20200520152250886" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Ask the customer if he would like to use one of his stored cards by quoting the <em>Ending in</em> number. If he does wish to use a stored card click on <em>Select Card</em>. If a new card is to be used click on <em>+ Add New Card</em> (this will revert you to take the card details in the normal way).</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200520152352783.png" alt="image-20200520152352783" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>If you have clicked on Select Card, the registered address for that card will display – check with the customer that this is still the correct address.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200520152414434.png" alt="image-20200520152414434" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>If the address is correct click <em>Yes</em>. </p>
<p>Now ask the customer for the 3 digits from the back of his card (even though the card is stored, this is still required as a security measure). Enter the 3 digits and then click on <em>Next</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200520152507427.png" alt="image-20200520152507427" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Confirm with the customer the amount you are about to take and the card ending in number.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200520152523444.png" alt="image-20200520152523444" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>If the customer agrees click on <em>Yes</em>.</p>
<p>You will be taken to the normal Payment Confirmation page where you can email or print a receipt for the customer.</p>
<h3 id="updatingastoredcardbillingaddress"><strong>Updating a Stored Card Billing Address</strong></h3>
<p>If the billing address for the card the customer wishes to use needs updating, click on <em>No</em> at the checking stage.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200520155958589.png" alt="image-20200520155958589" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>You now have the option to edit the current billing address or add a new address.</p>

<p>When the address has been updated or a new one added, click <em>Save/Update Address</em>.</p>
<p>Then follow the process of entering the 3 digits from the card and take the payment as shown above.</p>
<h2 id="cardpaymentsusinghandpoint">Card Payments using Handpoint</h2>

<p>Payments need to be correctly allocated in Harbour Assist for a number of reasons:-</p>
<ul>
<li>To identify any missing or incomplete payments,</li>
<li>To ensure that debt reporting and aging is accurate,</li>
<li>To ensure that the information shown on the customers' online portal is correct and in line with their expectations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Payments should be fully allocated to an invoice wherever possible at the time of taking the payment (see below), however there may be occasions when this is not possible and it is left on the account as an unnallocated payment.</p>
<p>?&gt; More documentation <a href="AccountsOrdersPayments/Payments">here</a></p>
<p>The <em>Reporting</em> section of Harbour Assist has an <em>Unallocated Payments</em> report so that these are easily identifiable.</p>

<h2 id="toallocateanunallocatedpayment">To Allocate an Unallocated Payment</h2>
<p>There are 2 ways to allocate an unallocated payment.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Tools</em> button which is found on in the top Toolbar on an Account, or</li>
<li>The <em>Actions</em> button on <em>Orders</em> page.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="usingthetoolsbutton">Using the Tools Button</h3>
<p>Click on the <em>Tools</em> button in the top Toolbar of an Account, and then <em>Allocate Payments</em>.</p>

<h3 id="usingtheactionsbutton">Using the Actions Button</h3>
<p>Click on the <em>Actions</em> button of any unallocated payment (unallocated are shaded in red), and then <em>Allocate</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191223115300521.png" alt="image-20191223115300521" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Either route will take you to the same <em>Allocate Payments</em> screen which will display all unallocated payments and all unpaid orders.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191223112835071.png" alt="image-20191223112835071" class="img-thumbnail"></p>

<p>If you want to allocate the whole of the payment to this order you can now just confirm your selection, however if you only want to allocate some of the payment to this order, you can change the allocation amount.  The remaining amount will be left available to allocate to another order.</p>

<p>Although we may not like the idea, sometimes you do need to give money back to a customer!</p>
<p>The actual transferring of the money isn't done through Harbour Assist, but the refund does need to be recorded in the system so that the account balance is correct.</p>
<p>In order to record a Refund on Harbour Assist there needs to be an unallocated payment (or part unallocated) to refund against.  This could be a credit note that you have raised, or an actual payment that the customer has made.</p>
<p>?&gt; More documentation on Credit Notes can be found <a href="AccountsOrdersPayments/CreditNotes.md">here</a></p>
<h2 id="recordingarefund">Recording a Refund</h2>

<p>Tariffs &amp; Pricebooks are a key element of the system and are used when creating an Order of any type.</p>
<h2 id="whatisatariff">What is a Tariff</h2>
<p>A Tariff is how we refer to a product or service sold.  Each Tariff will have a name, price, calculation type and will be put into a category - this will help you to find the correct Tariff when creating an Order.</p>
<p>?&gt; More documentation <a href="Administration/OrderTypes">here</a></p>
<h2 id="calculationtypes">Calculation Types</h2>
<p>Each Tariff has a <em>Calculation Type</em> - these are there to avoid end-users having to perform manual calculations and therefore reduce the risk of human error.  There are many Calculation Types, but the most commonly used are - Single, Length Overall (LOA), Per Night, LOA Per Night - these are explained below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single</strong> - This should be used for Tariffs which have a price per item i.e. Laundry tokens, gas bottles etc. or if a berth/mooring is sold at a set price and is not dependent on the length of a craft.  When raising an order the quantity should be set for the number of items being purchased i.e. if 6 laundry tokens @ £2.80 each are required, the quantity of 6 should be selected and the price will be calculated 6 x £2.80 = £16.80.  Likewise for a berth/mooring with a set price of £5,500, the quantity of 1 should be selected and the price will be calculated 1 x £5,500 = £5,500.  </li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191218145908428.png" alt="image-20191218145908428" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191218145723705.png" alt="image-20191218145723705" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>?&gt; NB. Some Tariffs can have variable prices and are therefore set at £0 - for these Tariffs the <em>Single</em> Calculation Type should be used - the quantity selected when raising an order should be 1 and this will then enable you to manually type in the total price to be charged.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Length Overall (LOA)</strong> - This calculation is used for Tariffs that are chargeable by the length of a craft i.e. the price of an annual Leisure Mooring is £239 per metre and the craft the order is being raised for is 15.6 metres in length - when raising the order the quantity of 1 should be selected, the system will automatically calculate the price of the mooring £239 x 15.6m = £3,728.40.  </p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191218151656346.png" alt="image-20191218151656346" class="img-thumbnail"></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Per Night</strong> - Mainly used for visiting craft - the Tariff is a per night cost i.e. it is £30 per night for a visitor mooring.  When raising an Order the dates for the period of the stay should be selected from the calendar - this will show the number of nights that will be charged for - then the quantity of 1 should be selected.  The system will automatically calculate the price from the number of nights.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191219131552663.png" alt="image-20191219131552663" class="img-thumbnail"></p></li>
<li><p><strong>LOA Per Night</strong> - Again this is mainly used for visiting craft, but the Tariff is calculated per night x the length of the craft.  When raising an Order the dates for the period of the stay should be selected from the calendar - this will show the number of nights that will be charged for - then the quantity of 1 should be selected.  The system will automatically calculate the price from the number of nights x the length of the craft.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="creatinganewtariff">Creating a New Tariff</h2>
<p>The ability to create a new <em>Tariff</em> is permission based; the <em>Permission</em> required for this is <em>AdministrationTariffs</em>.</p>
<p>From the <em>Home</em> page select <em>Administration</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191218154746722.png" alt="image-20191218154746722" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Then select <em>Tariffs</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200820142417044.png" alt="image-20200820142417044" class="img-thumbnail"></p>

<p>Complete the information required; the following tips will help:-</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong> - give the Tariff a name that will make sense to users and customers as this will appear on their order.</li>
<li><strong>Code</strong> - give the Tariff a code - this can be anything you wish - it is often just an abbreviation of the tariff name.</li>
</ul>
<p>?&gt; NB: Each Tariff Name and Code should be unique to that Tariff.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Category</strong> - use the drop down list to select a Category or the + button to create a new one.</li>
<li><strong>Decimal Places</strong> - enter the number of decimal places, so for a tariff to appear as £1.99 the decimal places should be set to 2.</li>
<li><strong>VAT Rate</strong> - this should be entered as a decimal; 20% is 0.2, 5% is 0.05 etc.  Where VAT should not be charged enter 0.</li>
<li><strong>Calculation Type</strong> - select from the drop down list.</li>
</ul>
<p>Completion of all the other cells is optional.</p>

<p>The next stage is to add the <em>Tariff</em> to the relevant <em>Pricebooks</em> and <em>Order Types</em>.</p>

<h2 id="explainingpricebooks">Explaining Pricebooks</h2>
<p>Pricebooks exist in order to allow different Sites to have different prices for the same Tariff i.e. the price of an annual residential mooring at one site could be £5,500, but another site could charge £6,500.  By using Pricebooks the same Tariff can be used -  for instance 'Residential - 1 payment' but by selecting the Pricebook for the site the order is being raised for, the correct price will be charged.  This takes away the need for multiple Tariffs for the same product being created.</p>
<p>The Pricebook you wish to use should be selected from the Tariff Selection page when raising an Order.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20191218154557027.png" alt="image-20191218154557027" class="img-thumbnail"> </p>
<p>Pricebooks can also be set for a period of time i.e. the Pricebook for the calendar year of 2019 should be used for Orders during that period.  A new Pricebook can be created, by Cloning the existing one, for the calendar year of 2020 with revised prices - this could be an across board increase of 2% for instance. This enables annual pricing changes to be released in a controlled manner.</p>
<p>?&gt; For more information about Cloning a Pricebook click <a href="AccountsOrdersPayments/TariffsPricebooks?id=cloning-a-pricebook.md">here</a>.</p>
<p>Pricebooks for previous years can be archived, but will still be held on the system so that they can be referred to if necessary.</p>

<p>Your <em>Pricebook</em> has now been created in <em>Draft</em>.</p>
<p>The next step is to add the <em>Tariffs</em> to the <em>Pricebook</em>.</p>

<h2 id="cloningapricebook">Cloning a Pricebook</h2>
<p>The easiest way to create a <em>Pricebook</em> to apply any increases year on year is to <em>Clone</em> an existing <em>Pricebook</em>.  The new <em>Pricebook</em> can still be amended; prices adjusted, tariffs added and removed etc, before you publish it.</p>
<p>To clone a <em>Pricebook</em> from the <em>Home</em> page select <em>Administration</em>.</p>

<p>Give the new <em>Pricebook</em> a name and enter the % increase that you wish to apply to the <em>Tariffs</em>.</p>
<p>?&gt; NB: The % increase will be applied to all tariffs, so some manual adjustment is inevitable.  Enter the % increase that applies to the majority of the tariffs so that fewer adjustments are necessary.  If the majority of the tariffs are staying the same enter 0.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AccountsOrdersPayments/image-20200821104959076.png" alt="image-20200821104959076" class="img-thumbnail"></p>

<h2 id="whatisanoccupancy">What is an Occupancy?</h2>
<p>An Occupancy is simply a record that represents an Account or a Boat occupying an Asset for a duration of time.  Each Occupancy record can be linked to each of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Account (mandatory)</li>
<li>Boat (optional)</li>
<li>Asset (optional, but usually completed)</li>
<li>Order (optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea behind Occupancy records is to allow you to know who is where in your Marina/Harbour now and at any time in the past, report on capacity, keep track of how your assets are being used and provide accountability.</p>
<h2 id="fieldsassociatedwithanoccupancy">Fields associated with an Occupancy</h2>
<p>In addition to the above, we store the following information for each Occupancy:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Start Date:</em>  When the Occupancy started - for Visitors this would be their Arrival Date, for Annual Customers it would be the start of their contract.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Depart Date:</em> When they left/end date of their contract.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Occupancy Type:</em>  What is the type of Occupancy?  This will define which Assets they are allowed to be placed on.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Departed?:</em> Whether the Occupancy has actually left.  This is primarily used for Visitors.  </p>
<p>?&gt; More documentation <a href="visitors/VisitorDepart">here</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="occupancytypes">Occupancy Types</h2>
<p>Each Occupancy has an <em>Occupancy Type</em>, which, above providing reportability on usage, also controls:</p>
<ul>
<li>The default Start &amp; End Date.</li>
<li>Which assets the occupancy can be placed on.</li>
<li>Visual information for the calendar such as icon and colour.</li>
</ul>
<p>To create a new <em>Occupancy Type</em> or amend an existing one, from the Home page select <em>Administration</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AssetsOccupancy/image-20191223143620793.png" alt="image-20191223143620793" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Then select <em>Occupancy Types</em>.</p>

<p>The Occupancy Calendar assists users to carry out checks to ensure that all craft within the marina are either on a long term mooring contract or paying for visitor moorings.</p>
<p>Craft can be moved location by using this function, thus ensuring the system is always up to date with factual occupancy information and shows which berths/moorings are occupied or vacant.</p>
<p>From the <em>Home</em> page select <strong>Occupancy</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="findingyourwayaroundtheoccupancyview">Finding your way around the Occupancy view</h2>
<p>The Occupancy view can be filtered in many ways to aid you in finding the information you require.</p>
<p>Multi-site operators should firstly select the site you wish to view by using the drop down arrow next to the <em>Site</em> title.  </p>
<p>You can view the Occupancy by 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks or a month by selecting the view on the right hand side of the screen.</p>
<p>To move to the next 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks or a month, use the arrow keys on the right hand side of the screen, or to move to a specific date use the Calendar icon to select the date.  You can return to todays' date by clicking on </p>

<p>You can then select a specific area of the site by clicking on the blue buttons  which outline the different Regions of the site.</p>
<p>The view below is filtered to show just the Car Park.</p>
<p>If you wish to remove the filter and return to seeing the whole of the site, just click on the Red filter icon.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AssetsOccupancy/image-20200103143548168.png" alt="image-20200103143548168" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Some of your Assets may have been classified as <em>Unusable</em> - ie. it is not available for Occupancy, if you wish these to show on the Occupancy screen you need to check the <em>Include Unusable</em> box.  These Assets will then appear in a shaded red colour.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/AssetsOccupancy/image-20200103145259492.png" alt="image-20200103145259492" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>The Assets that are occupied will show an occupancy line - the colour of these lines will vary depending on the type of occupancy i.e. Residential, Leisure, Visitor etc., so at a glance you can see the type of occupancy on that mooring/berth. </p>
<p>Within the occupancy line the text gives the name of the Account holder, the Boat that the occupancy relates to and the duration of the occupancy.</p>
<p>?&gt; NB: For short occupancy periods not all the above information will show in the occupancy line due to space limitations - it will however show if you hover over the line with your cursor.</p>
<p>The column in between the Asset names and the calendar shows who the mooring/berth is licenced to. </p>
<p>?&gt; More documentation <a href="Renewals/Licensing.md">here</a>.</p>
<p>When an occupancy is associated with an Order you will also see within the occupancy line the status of the Order - C for confirmed, D for draft - and whether there is an outstanding balance on that order.  If the Order has been paid you will see a £0 balance in green, for outstanding balances the amount will show in red.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>When dealing with Visiting craft, customers will inevitably change their minds, therefore the <em>Visitor Depart</em> function has been developed to:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow customers to change their mind and the system re-calculate what they owe,</li>
<li>ensure that all visitor revenue is captured. </li>
</ul>
<p>For this function to work correctly, all Visitor Occupancies must now be <em>Departed</em>.</p>
<p>To manage your Visitors, from the <em>Home</em> page, select <em>Visitor Depart</em>. </p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/visitors/image-20200430164201639.png" alt="image-20200430164201639" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>In the <em>Visitor Depart</em> screen, ensure the correct site is selected (for multi-site operators).  The screen will automatically populate to show all <strong>Asset Types</strong> that are currently <strong>Occupied</strong> with a <strong>Visitor</strong> occupancy and historic Visitor Occupanices who have not yet been marked as Departed.</p>
<p>?&gt; NB. To view Visitors who may be on Unusable Assets, please ensure you check the <em>Include Unusable</em> box.</p>

<p>The symbols in the <em>Depart</em> column mean you can easily see craft who are due to leave that day, the next day or who have <em>overstayed</em> their original intended occupancy.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/visitors/image-20200512114932417.png" alt="image-20200512114932417" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>The Order details are shown - <strong>Order</strong> Number and Status (Confirmed or Draft), <strong>Cost</strong>, how much has been <strong>Paid</strong>, <strong>Outstanding</strong> amount and <strong>Payment</strong> status.</p>
<p>If a Visitor Occupancy has been created and no order raised, the Visitor will show and there will be a <em>New Visitor Order</em> button showing in the Order/Schedule column. Use this to raise a Visitor Order for the Occupancy.</p>

<p>At this stage you can add, amend and remove any tariffs as necessary - for instance, you may have 1 customer where you have agreed a reduce rate - this is the point to make this adjustment.</p>
<p>If you want to view what the paperwork you will be sending out to customer looks like you can view this by clicking on the green <em>Actions</em> button on any of the entries and selecting View Document.</p>

<p>If there are a large number to print and you wish to break it down into smaller groups, you can select the number of pages to output - once you have done this click <em>Generate</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/Renewals/img/Batchrun21.png" alt="Query Editor" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>You will note that the Preview watermark has now been removed, so you can print in the same way you would any other document.</p>
<p>The Statistics now show that the emails have been sent and this also shows against the line entry.</p>
<p>As the Orders are paid  the Finance statistics will update automatically.</p>

<p>Harbour Assist allows you split berthing fees (or any other charge) across any number of months.  We do this by splitting the fees into the appropiately-costed Orders which only become due at specific times.  There are 2 terms which are important to understand:</p>
<h2 id="instalmentplans">Instalment Plans</h2>
<p>An Instalment Plan is a a <em>template</em> consisting of a number of month numbers with a corresponding percentage split to be applied on each Month.  Instalment Plans create off-the-shelf scenarios such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monthly over 12 months</li>
<li>Monthly over 6 months</li>
<li>Quarterly over 12 months</li>
<li>Quarterly over 24 months</li>
<li>Evenly over first 10 month of year</li>
</ul>
<p>Instalment Plans are only set up when a new pattern of payments is created.  </p>
<p>?&gt; There are no financial values nor dates in an Instalment Plan, just month numbers and percentages.  This is because the dates will depend on when the Schedule is generated, and the financial value will depend on the Site / Pricebook used.</p>
<p>?&gt; More documentation <a href="Instalments/InstalmentPlans">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="instalmentschedules">Instalment Schedules</h2>
<p>An Instalment Schedule is simply an Instalment Plan that has been applied to a specific Account with specific dates and amounts.  It represents a set of Monthly Orders belonging to a single Account, each of which having the tax-point dates for the correct due-dates and amounts that they will be owing you money (or paying you).  The table below explains the difference between Instalment Plans and Instalment Schedules.</p>
<p>| Concept                        | Instalment Plan | Instalment Schedule        |
| ------------------------------ | --------------- | -------------------------- |
| Months                         | Month Numbers   | Specific Payment due dates |
| Value split                    | Percentages     | Specific Instalment values |
| Relates to a specific Account? | N               | Y                          |
| Has a financial value?         | N               | Y                          |</p>

<h2 id="paymentschemes">Payment Schemes</h2>
<p>With the ability to create instalment-based debt, we need the ability to get the money; this is usually done in 1 of several ways and is defined against each Account.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manual</strong> - they just get emailed an Invoice each month and they pay online or over the phone. <em>Supported</em></li>
<li><strong>Direct Debit</strong> - The money is automatically debited from their account at the appropriate time. <em>Supported in the UK using BottomLine</em></li>
<li><strong>Card Drawdown</strong> - Using PaySafe's Card-Vault, when the instalment becomes due, the correct amount is drawn down automatically from the customer's stored card. <em>Coming soon</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>An Instalment Plan is a pre-configured template which can be used to generate individual Payment Schedules as required.  An Instalment Plan consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The name of the Plan</p></li>
<li><p>A table of Month number / percentage combinations which define how the value will be broken down over time.</p></li>
<li><p>Which Tariffs are allowed to be included when a Schedule is being created.</p></li>
<li><p>Email + File Attachments to standardise how the customer is communicated their contractual obligations.</p></li>

<p>You will be taken to the list of existing plans, where you can view existing or create a new one.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/Instalments/image-20191101153600514.png" alt="image-20191101153600514" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Creating a new Instalment Plan will prompt you to enter:</p>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> The friendly name of the Plan - e.g. "12 Month Resdiential"</p>
<p><strong>Order Type:</strong> The Order Type which will be used when generating the monthly Orders.</p>
<p><strong>Number of Months</strong>: Over how many months will the cost be split.</p>
<p><strong>Schedule</strong>: Here you can define which months should be included in the Plan.  The % split wil be automatically calculated for you.  Here you can add creativity to how the balance is paid.  e.g. </p>
<ul>
<li>Quarterly: Tick Months 1, 4, 7, 10.</li>
<li>Split over first 10 months of year: Tick Months 1-10.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now you can add the Tariffs that are available to use for the Instalment Plan (often different charges are applied if a customer is paying over instalments, so you don't want a User to be able to select a Tariff that is for a single payment charge).</p>
<p>Click on the <em>Tariffs</em> tab.</p>

<p>You will be prompted with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether to create a Custom Schedule.</li>
</ul>
<p>?&gt; This requires the "InstalmentCustomSchedules" permission.  If you don't have this permission you won't see this option.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Which Instalment Plan to use when generating the Schedule.  This will determine the number of months over which the value is split.</p></li>
<li><p>The Pricebook to use.  This will determine the value of Schedule.</p></li>
<li><p>Which month to start the Schedule from. </p></li>

<ul>
<li>Add the appropriate Tariffs.</li>
<li>Click on <em>Done</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Schedule screen will show the total value of the Schedule and how this breaks down on a per-month basis.  At this point, the Schedule isn't saved, it's in a "Proposed" State.  Whilst in this State, Tariffs can be added, Occupancy dates modified etc.  Once you are happy with the payment schedule, click on <em>Commit</em>.</p>
<p>?&gt; Once <em>Committed</em> an Instalment Schedule cannot be edited, it would need to be Credited out, so please be sure the schedule is correct.</p>

<p>The 2 currently supported Payment Schemes are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manual</strong> - The customers debt is managed via the usual debt management processes, with the instalments becoming debt at the right time.  We provide the ability to bulk-dispatch invoices.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Debit</strong> - This currently supported in the UK via Bottom Line Technologies.  Please let us know if you'd like to find out more.  <em>NB: Using the Bottom Line adapter incurs an additional monthly charge.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>You can configure the Payment Scheme at the bottom of the Account's "Account" tab.  Accounts will start out with the default "Manual" Payment Schemes.</p>
<p>?&gt; This action requires the "AccountPaymentSchemeEdit" Permission</p>

<h2 id="directdebitnewmandate">Direct Debit - New Mandate</h2>
<p>When you select "Direct Debit - Bottom Line" Payment Scheme you are prompted to fill in enough information for the Bank to accept a Mandate.  This information is exported to the bank set up a Direct Debit.</p>

<li><strong>Sort Code</strong> - 6 digit number - no hyphens or additional characters.</li>
<li><strong>Account Number 7</strong>- 8-10 digit number </li>
<li><strong>Account Holder</strong> - The name of the Account holder as known by the Bank.</li>

<p>Each month, you will want to collect the monies due for the Instalments due on that Month.  To do this, you create a <em>Drawdown Batch</em> which allows you to perform bulk actions depending on what Payment Scheme you select.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manual</strong> - Bulk email all Accounts with their Invoice, so they either pay online or pay via some other mechanism.</li>

<p>Instalment Schedules in Harbour Assist are just Orders with a Tax-Point Date set to the date at which the Order becomes due.  These appear alongside other Orders in the Account &gt; Orders Tab.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/Instalments/image-20191210122311671.png" alt="image-20191210122311671" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Instalment Orders appear slightly differently to standard Orders.</p>
<ul>
<li>They are slightly "Greyed out".</li>
<li>If they are not yet due, they have an icon next to their "Effective Date" indicating they are due in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, as they are part of a broaded <em>Instalment Schedule</em>, they have slightly different behaviour:</p>
<ul>
<li>They cannot be "Reverted to draft" regardless of your Permissions.</li>
<li>If they are paid early, their Tax Point Date moves back to the date of the payment to keep reporting accurate.</li>
</ul></body><br><hr/><head></head><body><h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>The Comms tab on an account is where you can create new communications for individual accounts and where all the communications are logged (both ad hoc and bulk communications).  The Communications show in date order with the most recent at the top.</p>

<p>You can also search by the communication subject by entering a key word; therefore giving the communication a sensible subject when creating it is important.</p>

<p>?&gt; NB. So that the Comms log doesn't get cluttered up with records of Orders, Receipt, Credit Notes etc that have been emailed, these do not show in the log of communications that you see by default.  To view these go to the very bottom of the Comms log and use the <em>Click here to show all email activity for this account</em> feature.</p>

<p>Give your letter a <em>subject</em> title - this title will appear in the <em>Comms</em> summary so be as clear as possible so that other colleagues looking at the communications have a good idea what the letter was about without having to open it.</p>
<p>Depending on which template you use, some details may be populated automatically for you - you can review your letter at any time by clicking on the Preview button which will show you your letter, the layout and any pre-populated information.</p>

<p>The Preview letter will open in a new tab on your device.  To go back to the letter you are creating just click back onto your Harbour Assist tab.</p>
<p>You now need to add your text to the letter - this is done in exactly the same way as when you are typing a letter in Word.</p>
<p>At any point during the letter writing process you can save your letter (it is advised to do so every few minutes) - this will save it as a draft which is still fully editable.</p>

<p>Give your email a <em>subject</em> - this will default to the template name, so be sure to change this so that it makes sense to the recipient.  This subject also appears in the <em>Communications</em> summary so be as clear as possible so that other colleagues looking at the communications have a good idea what the email was about without having to view it.</p>
<p>You will see that the email has been automatically populated with the account holders email address.</p>
<p>Now you can add any other recipients - </p>
<ul>
<li>You can manually enter email addresses to receive a CC or BCC</li>
<li>Add a Colleague ie. another user of Harbour Assist - choose their name from the drop down list and then click on CC or BCC (the green and yellow buttons) to add them.</li>
<li>Other parties - if the account has a boat that has a relationship with another account ie. there is a co-owner, these will show as Other Parties - just check any that require a CC of the email.</li>

<h2 id="trackmailbox">Track Mailbox</h2>
<p>To help you include important emails in an Account's Communication history, Harbour Assist provides a <em>Track</em> mailbox that allows you to forward emails from anywhere.  </p>
<p>This <em>Track</em> address will show at the top of any Comms page.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/communications/image-20200221170103101.png" alt="image-20200221170103101" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p><strong>As long as the email address stored in Harbour Assist is somewhere in the message, the email will be picked up and attached as a Communication against the Account.</strong></p>
<p>This can be used when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have received an email from a Customer directly into your inbox and you think it's worthwhile appearing Account's Communication history.  For example if they have made a complaint.</li>
<li>Emails you send from Outlook that you want to appear in Harbour Assist.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sendingfromyouremailaccount">Sending from your Email Account</h3>
<p>If sending the email from your company email system (e.g. Outlook), the <em>Track</em> address should be entered in the Bcc address field of the email.</p>
<p>By doing this, the email will automatically be attached to the account as long as the email address on the account matches the email address you are using to send the email.</p>
<p>As described above, replies received from account holders can be logged on their Harbour Assist account by forwarding the response to the <em>Track</em> email address.  Again the email address in the Account needs to match the one contained in the email.</p></body><br><hr/><head></head><body><h1 id="loggingphonecallsmeetings">﻿Logging Phone Calls &amp; Meetings</h1>

<p>Give your phone call a <em>subject</em> title - this title will appear in the <em>Comms</em> summary so be as clear as possible so that other colleagues looking at the communications have a good idea what the call was about without having to view it.</p>
<p>Select <em>Outgoing or Incoming</em> - again this will be logged in the <em>Comms</em> summary - and then give the pertinent details of the call.</p>

<p>In many instances communications with Account holders are repetitive - for instance, the sending out of a standard form which requires a covering email.  In cases like this it is beneficial to have a template email which can just be selected and then edited if necessary to suit each individual communication.  This also ensures a consistent standard of communication to Account holders.</p>
<p>To create an Email template, first select the <em>Administration</em> tile on the <em>Home</em> page.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/communications/image-20200304172928268.png" alt="image-20200304172928268" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Now select <em>Email/SMS/Letter Templates</em> which is found in <em>Communication &amp; Document Tools</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/communications/image-20200304173036967.png" alt="image-20200304173036967" class="img-thumbnail"></p>

<p>Give your template a name - this should be as descriptive as possible so that it is easy for all members of staff to select the correct template - then select the <em>Channel</em> of Email.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/communications/image-20200304173339758.png" alt="image-20200304173339758" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Now put a title in the subject box - this is the default subject that the Account holders will see when the email is sent.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/communications/image-20200304173524042.png" alt="image-20200304173524042" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>If you want the end user to be able to edit the email tick the <em>Allow Body Editing</em> box - however, if you do not want the template to be able to be edited in any way, ensure this box is unchecked.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/communications/image-20200304173603272.png" alt="image-20200304173603272" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>You can now write the body of your email, inserting the merge fields by using the <em>Insert Merge Field</em> dropdown where you want information to populate the email automatically.  </p>
<p>When you have finished, click <em>Save</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/communications/image-20200304174117395.png" alt="image-20200304174117395" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>As well as standard merge fields for insertion, we also offer <em>Snippets</em> - these are selection of information or links that can be automatically populated into an email template.  Take a look to see what's on offer.</p>

<p>When you have finished, click <em>Save</em>.  </p>
<p>Your Template will not appear in the drop down list of email templates until you check the <em>Enabled</em> box.  This function enables you to work on a template over a period of time without it being available for use, or you could prepare templates in advance and then enable them at the appropriate time. </p>
<p>If you want to your template to be available for use straight away make sure it is <em>Enabled</em> -  and then select <em>Back to Templates List</em>.</p>

<p>Most businesses have a set of standard letters that are used for communicating with Account holders - whether it be chasing for debt, or inviting them to renew their mooring contract. </p>
<p>These templates can be held in Harbour Assist for all users to access and use.</p>
<p>The first stage of creating a letter template is to create a 'Letterhead' Word document.  This template can then be used as a basis for most other templates.</p>
<h2 id="creatingawordtemplate">Creating a Word Template</h2>
<p>Using Headers and Footers in Word create a document that fits with your company brand.  </p>
<p>Insert a table into the Header and within the table add the merge fields so that your relevant site information is merged into the Header and in the position that fits with your brand.</p>
<p>?&gt; NB: When inserting merge fields you are best to display them in their 'raw' format - to see this when creating your template in Word press Alt + F9.</p>
<p>Ensure when adding the company Logo that you place this within a text box in the table - this will mean you can control the size that your logo appears on the template</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/communications/image-20200326150931095.png" alt="image-20200326150931095" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Outside of the table (but within the header) insert the merge fields of TableStart:Accounts and TableEnd:Accounts.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/communications/image-20200326150545590.png" alt="image-20200326150545590" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Design the Footer (if required) in the same way, ensuring that if your are inserting any merge fields, rather than just text, you use the TableStart:Accounts and TableEnd:Accounts to 'surround' them.</p>
<p>Now you can insert the merge fields in the body of the template so that the standard information required for every letter to a customer is automatically populated in the letter.</p>
<p>Again you need to use the TableStart:Accounts merge field at the beginning and TableEnd:Accounts at the end for detail such as <em>Name, Address, Account Number and Date</em> to be shown in the template.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/communications/image-20200326162409110.png" alt="image-20200326162409110" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>This is how the above template will ultimately look when created in Harbour Assist.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/communications/image-20200326162734306.png" alt="image-20200326162734306" class="img-thumbnail"> </p>
<p>Now you can save your template in Harbour Assist.</p>
<p>From the <em>Home</em> page select <em>Administration</em>.  </p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/communications/image-20200304172928268.png" alt="image-20200304172928268" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Now select <em>Document Library</em> which is found in <em>Communication &amp; Document Tools</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/communications/image-20200326163024058.png" alt="image-20200326163024058" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Click on <em>New Word Template</em></p>

<p>Complete the information required on the lift hand side of the screen, giving your template a name, setting the Template Type (please see explanations under each type) and selecting what data to include.  </p>
<p>For a standard Letterhead Template you would select the Template Type of Letterhead.</p>
<p>The data to include for a standard letter would be <em>AccountWithBoats</em>, for more complex templates you would use other data, ie. for a Statement or Debt Letter you would use <em>OutstandingConfirmedOrders</em>.</p>
<p>Then click <em>Save</em>.</p>

<p>Give your template a name and select <em>Letter</em> in the Channel drop down box.  </p>
<p>Give your template a Subject name - this will appear in the Account Comms tab, so it needs to be something that will help users identify what the letter was about without having to open the letter to see.</p>
<p>Then select which Word Template you want to use.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/communications/image-20200406162940366.png" alt="image-20200406162940366" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>If you do not want your Template to be available for use straight away, remember to uncheck the <em>Enabled</em> box.  For templates that you do not want other users to be able to edit you can also uncheck the Allow Body Editing box, however this should only be done if you are certain end users will not need to edit the letter in any way.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/communications/image-20200406163244472.png" alt="image-20200406163244472" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>You can now add any standard text that you wish to appear in the letter - for a Standard Letter Template this will normally be instruction to add text, however for other templates you can write the full body of the letter.</p>
<p>When you have done this, click <em>Save</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/communications/image-20200406164335464.png" alt="image-20200406164335464" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>The template is now ready for use through the Comms tab on the Account page.</p>

<p>You will note that you do not see the Word template in this screen, just the detail you added to the Communication template.  When you have added your text (if it is a blank template) or made any edits to the template wording you can preview the letter.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/communications/image-20200406164534843.png" alt="image-20200406164534843" class="img-thumbnail"></p>

<h2 id="templatessuitableformailmerge">Templates Suitable for Mail Merge</h2>
<p>If you are planning on using a Template for a mail merge you will want a signature to automatically appear on the letter - the last thing you want to be doing is manually signing a large amount of letters!</p>
<p>Signatures need to be added to the Word Template as you are not able to add them to a Communication Template.</p>
<p>Create a Word Template by following the instructions in <em>Creating a Word Template</em>, ensuring you add a signature at the bottom of the template.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/communications/img/Lettertemplates22.png" alt="Query Editor" class="img-thumbnail"></p>

<p>Sometimes it's useful to attach a document like a marina/harbour map, blank form, your Terms &amp; Conditions to an email - these are known as static files.</p>
<p>A static file is a document that doesn't change, so has no customer or boat information merged into it ie. the content is Static rather than Dynamic.  </p>
<p>Static files can be uploaded into Harbour Assist so that they can easily be attached to an email to a customer.  The benefit of uploading static files into Harbour Assist is that they can be easily maintained and updated in one place, rather than multiple users having the same document saved on their desktop or in files etc where there is a risk that old versions may be attached to emails.</p>
<p>?&gt; NB: The uploading of Static Files is permission based; the Permission required is <strong>AdministrationTemplates</strong>.</p>
<p>To upload a Static File; from the <em>Home</em> page select <em>Administration</em>.</p>

<p>If you wish to send a highly formatted email to customers (a newsletter for example that contains lots of pictures), this can be designed outside of Harbour Assist in a another programme (such as Mailchimp) and then uploaded into Harbour Assist for sending.</p>
<p>In order to upload the document to Harbour Assist the HTML needs to be in its raw format.</p>
<p>Most programmes have instructions on how to do this - just Google <em>Export HTML Template from xxxxx (insert programme name)</em>.</p>
<p>Once you have the document in its raw format it can be copied and pasted into a new email template by using the Source Code function.</p>
<p>From the <em>Home</em> page select <em>Administration</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/communications/image-20200304172928268.png" alt="image-20200304172928268" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Now select <em>Email/SMS/Letter Templates</em> which is found in <em>Communication &amp; Document Tools</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/communications/image-20200304173036967.png" alt="image-20200304173036967" class="img-thumbnail"></p>

<p>Give your template a name - this should be as descriptive as possible so that it is easy for all members of staff to select the correct template - then select the <em>Channel</em> of Email.</p>
<p>Now put a title in the subject box - this is the default subject that the Account holders will see when the email is sent.</p>

<p>The clue is in the name - Smart Lists are lists that are purely defined by the data held within Harbour Assist.  As the data changes, the lists are automatically updated without any intervention.  So if you have a list that shows all accounts with a debt over 90 days, once that debt is paid the account is removed from the list automatically.  Likewise if you have an account with a debt that becomes 90 days overdue, they are added to the list. These lists are Smart!</p>
<p>Smart Lists can be used purely to gather statistics or to send bulk communications to groups of customers.</p>
<p>Following our re-development of Smart Lists you can now create lists using any of the following record types:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Accounts</li>
<li>Assets</li>
<li>Boats</li>
<li>Communications</li>
<li>Documents</li>
<li>Occupancies</li>
<li>Orders</li>
<li>Payments</li>
<li>Tasks</li>
<li>Waiting List Items</li>
</ul>
<p>This gives you huge flexibility to mine your data and find information.  You'll be able to use our intuitive Query Builder to create your perfect list, but there's bound to be some combinations we haven't thought of yet, so please do let us know if you come across anything by raising a help ticket within the system.</p></body><br><hr/><head></head><body><h1 id="creatingasmartlist">Creating a Smart List</h1>
<p>To create a Smart List, from the <em>Home</em> page, click on <strong>Smart List Hub</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/smartlists/image-20210427123512214.png" alt="image-20210427123512214" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Then choose <strong>Smart Lists</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/smartlists/image-20210423152513878.png" alt="image-20210423152513878" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Now you need to decide which records type you want to create the Smart List for.  Think about what detail you are trying to find or which group of customers you want to contact, here are a few examples and which type of List to create:-</p>
<ul>
<li>To send an email to the owners of all boats that are currently occupying a berth or occupied a berth during the last month etc - you need to create an <em>Occupancy</em> Smart List,</li>
<li>You want to find all boats over a certain length, or of a particular type - you need to create a <em>Boats</em> Smart List,</li>
<li>Maybe to want to request customers to send you their up to date boat insurance certificate - create a <em>Documents</em> Smart List.</li>
</ul>
<p>?&gt; Top Tip: Because Smart Lists are always up to date, you can use the same list over and over again; there's no need to create a new one each time, so before you create a new list check whether one already exists by using the search function.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/smartlists/image-20210427155121165.png" alt="image-20210427155121165" class="img-thumbnail"></p>

<p>To create a new Smart List you can either click on the + button against the Record Type that you want to use or select from the drop down options that show then you click on <em>Create a New Smart List</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/smartlists/image-20210427155419197.png" alt="image-20210427155419197" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Both ways will take you to the <em>Query Builder</em> page.  </p>
<p>?&gt; NB: The Criteria of <strong>Account - Status &gt; Equal &gt; Live</strong> is now added by default - if you <strong>do</strong> wish to include Archived Accounts you can remove this by clicking on the <em>Bin</em> icon.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/smartlists/image-20210423155607133.png" alt="image-20210423155607133" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Now you can start to build you list by adding the <em>Criteria</em>.  Click on either the <em>+Add Criteria</em> button or the <em>+Add First Criteria</em> button to get going.</p>

<p>In this example I am creating a <em>Tasks</em> Smart List.  I want a summary of all <em>Customer Contact</em> tasks that have been created since 1st January this year.</p>
<p>First I add the <em>Task - Type</em> criteria, </p>

<p>Followed by the <em>Task - Created on</em> criteria.</p>

<p>?&gt; NB: When changing the smart list criteria the report no longer updates with every change. When you have changed, added or removed any criteria you now have to hit the "Run Report" button to update the results.  This change means that Smart Lists are now much quicker to load!</p>
<p>The page will display the record count results in the big green box at the top of the page and at the bottom of the page you will see a dashboard summary of the results.  The results that are displayed will depend on the type of Smart List you are creating.</p>

<p>If you want to add any of these results to the Criteria of the list, just click on the name - For example, what if I forgot that I only wanted to see Completed Tasks, and didn’t set that Criteria?  Clicking on the <em>True</em> in the <em>Completed</em> results will add that Criteria to the list for me.  You just have to remember to hit the <strong>Run Report</strong> button again.</p>

<p>Give your list a name (remember to give it a sensible name so that other users can find it if they search), decide whether you want the list to be Private or Public and then Save or Save &amp; Lock.</p>
<p>?&gt; NB: If you Lock a Smart List only Users with the Permission of <strong>SmartListAdministrator</strong> will be able to unlock it.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>To allow HA to categorise documents that are uploaded against an Account, there are now the concept of Document Types.  An example of a Document Type could be <em>Insurance Certificate</em>.  Account Document Types are configurable via the Administration area.  Each Document Type can have an expiry duration configured against it consisting of a number of days, weeks, months or years.  </p>
<p>When a document is uploaded, its Expiry Date is calculated &amp; this is then flagged as and when it becomes expired.  </p>
<p>When a user uploads a new Document, you can opt to replace the previous version, allowing you to quickly see the current version of a given Document Type as well as historical versions.</p>
<p>We've also integrated this into the ability to send docs to a docs tracking mailbox.  By specifying a "Mailbox suffix" to the Document Type, you can set up different mailboxes for each Document Type.  For instance setting up a Document Type of "Insurance Certificate" with a mailbox suffix of <em>insurance</em> would mean that any attachments sent to <strong>docs-insurance@xxxxxxxx.harbourassist.com</strong> will be attached to the account with a Document Type of <em>Insurance</em>.</p>
<h2 id="creatingadocumenttype">Creating a Document Type</h2>

<p>Most companies have routine inspections that need to be carried out on a regular basis, whether it be on assets, buildings, equipment or plant.  These inspections can be recorded in Harbour Assist so that there is a full inspection record.</p>
<p>The first stage to setting up Inspections in Harbour Assist is to create an Inspection Regime.  This Regime can then be attached to an asset, building, piece of equipment or plant.</p>
<p>From the <em>Home</em> page, select <em>Asset Maintenance</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/Maintenance/image-20200414162526040.png" alt="image-20200414162526040" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Then select <em>Inspection Regime Setup</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/Maintenance/image-20200414162636987.png" alt="image-20200414162636987" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Click on <em>New Inspection Regime</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/Maintenance/image-20200414162801895.png" alt="image-20200414162801895" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Give your regime a name, then click <em>Create</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/Maintenance/image-20200414162933789.png" alt="image-20200414162933789" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Most Regimes will have more than one type of Inspection - for instance, large items of Plant may require a <em>Daily Inspection</em> before each use, however this is likely to be a brief inspection comprising of only a few checks; a more comprehensive <em>Monthly Inspection</em> could also be required, this will be more in depth and have different aspects to it; there could then also be an <em>Annual Inspection</em> which is a thorough inspection, possibly carried out by a different person/team.  Each of these are known as <em>Inspection Types</em>.</p>
<p>To set up a new Inspection Type, select <em>New Inspection Type</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/Maintenance/image-20200414163259931.png" alt="image-20200414163259931" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Now you need to set the parameters of the Inspection:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Give it a Name</li>
<li>Set the Recurrence</li>
<li>Set the Schedule Type</li>
<li>Finally, assign the inspection to Team - a task will be sent to alert them when an inspection is due.</li>
</ul>
<p>When complete click on <em>Create</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/Maintenance/image-20200414163520152.png" alt="image-20200414163520152" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>The details entered will show in the Schedule.  You should now write a briefing for the Inspection ie. some basic instructions on how the Inspection should be carried out.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/Maintenance/image-20200414163834864.png" alt="image-20200414163834864" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>The next stage is to set the specific <em>Checks</em> that need to be carried out. A <em>Check</em> is data that needs to be captured during an Inspection.  </p>
<p>Click the <em>Add</em> button.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/Maintenance/image-20200414164415087.png" alt="image-20200414164415087" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Enter some text - a brief description, then select the <em>Capture Type</em> - this is the way you want to capture the information.  There are 4 options:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Checkbox - a tick box which is a confirmation you have carried out the check.</li>
<li>Number - when the response must be in a number format.</li>
<li>Dropdown - a selection list of possible answers - <strong>see below for instruction on how to do this</strong>.</li>
<li>Text - a text box for the user to write their response to the check.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish to make the check <em>Mandatory</em>, check the box - this means the user will not be able to skip the check.</p>
<p>Then click <em>Save</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/Maintenance/image-20200414164649787.png" alt="image-20200414164649787" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>You can now set your next check by clicking on the <em>Add</em> button again.</p>
<h2 id="creatingacapturetypedropdownlist">Creating a Capture Type Dropdown List</h2>
<p>When you select the Capture Type of <em>Dropdown</em>, this will bring up an additional cell so that you can set the <em>Values</em>.  To add the <em>Values</em> click on the green + button.</p>

<p>Set each Value by typing the description in the cell and then clicking on the Green tick.  You can add as many as you wish and if you change your mind you can remove them  by clicking on the Red trash icon.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/Maintenance/image-20200427155318195.png" alt="image-20200427155318195" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>When you have finished your dropdown list, click on <em>Save</em>.</p>
<p>Each <em>Check</em> and the set up of it will show under <em>Checks</em>, you can change any of the details by selecting the Green <em>Action</em> button and selecting Edit.</p>

<p>Once complete the Inspection you have set up will show in the <em>Inspection Regime</em>.</p>

<p>Any Asset can have an Inspection Regime attached to it, however there may be a number of Assets that need to be set up in Harbour Assist for the sole purpose of carrying out Inspections.</p>
<p>These <em>Inspection Assets</em> can be set up individually in the same way as any Asset, however if a bulk upload of <em>Inspections Assets</em> is required please contact the team at Harbour Assist by raising a Help ticket.</p>
<p>?&gt; More documentation <a href="AssetsOccupancy/Assets?id=creating-a-new-asset.md">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>So that everything is kept neat and tidy and your system doesn't get littered up with old accounts, it is good practice to archive accounts when customers leave.  You don't want to be sending bulk communications with details of things like access code changes etc to those who are no longer your customers.</p>
<p>There's a few things to note:-</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Archiving an account doesn't mean you will lose any information - it will all still be there on the archived account.</p></li>
<li><p>When searching, archived accounts will still show in the results, but they will appear in red and below any live accounts.
<img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/Housekeeping/image-20201221145822376.png" alt="image-20201221145822376" class="img-thumbnail"></p></li>
<li><p>You <strong>can</strong> archive an account that has a debt or credit balance - they will still appear in the debt reports.</p></li>
<li><p>You <strong>cannot</strong> archive an account that has open Tasks - these will need to be completed or deleted.  A pop-up message will appear informing you if there are open tasks on an account.</p></li>
<li><p>You <strong>cannot</strong> archive an account if the account or any of its boats are licensed to an Asset - the license will need to be removed.  A pop-up message will appear informing you of the license details.</p></li>
<li><p>Archiving an account will:-</p></li>
<li><p>Archive all the owned boats on the account,</p></li>
<li><p>Prevent the creation of any further orders,</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the account and its boats from all waiting lists.</p></li>

<h2 id="explainingordertypes">Explaining Order Types</h2>
<p><strong>Order Types</strong> are a description of the goods or services that are being provided and purchased.</p>
<p>Once an Account is created with an <em>Account Type</em> (see below for more information) an Order can be raised.   Multiple orders with different <strong>Order Types</strong> can be raised for an Account.</p>
<p>?&gt; More documentation on Accounts can be found <a href="AccountsOrdersPayments/Accounts">here</a></p>
<p>Each Order is assigned a single <strong>Order Type</strong>, and the <strong>Order Type</strong> will determine:-</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Tariffs</em> available for composing the Order (see Tariffs and Pricebooks)</li>
<li>The Invoice/Receipt template format</li>
<li>Custom Order-level data capture.</li>
</ul>
<p>?&gt; More documentation on Tariffs and Pricebooks can be found <a href="AccountsOrdersPayments/TariffsPricebooks">here</a></p>
<p><strong>Order Types</strong> are bespoke to each business using the Harbour Assist system. </p>
<p>Amendments to existing <strong>Order Types</strong> and creation of new ones can be carried out by Users who have the relevant permissions to enable them to do so.  </p>

<p>After the initial set up of Order Types there should be very little need to amend any of the details within the <em>info</em> tab of the Order Types.</p>
<p>You can add or edit the description in the <em>Guidelines</em> box - this is what users see when they are selecting the Order Type.  A detailed, accurate description in here will help users make the correct Order Type selection and avoid incorrect orders being raised.</p>
<p>If necessary, you can upload an invoice template or receipt that is bespoke to this particular Order Type.</p>

<p>By clicking on these icons you can Add or Remove the Tariffs from the Included Tariffs.</p>
<p>Even though you only want certain Tariffs to show by default for a certain Order Type, there may be occasions when other Tariffs need to be added.  For instance, whilst raising an order for a Leisure Mooring the customer may also want to purchase a gas bottle at the same time.  To give flexibility to Users to add items such as this, ensure the <em>Allow User to Override Visible Tariffs</em> box is ticked.</p>

<p>Viewing the tasks of a User or Team can help with workload management - you can see what they need to do on a daily basis via an outlook-style calendar.  </p>
<h2 id="taskelements">Task Elements</h2>
<p>There are a number of elememts to a task, some of these should be set when creating a task:-</p>

<li>Type - this should be chosen from the drop down choices.</li>
<li>Due date - an appropriate due date should be chosen, taking into account working days, urgency of the task and workload.</li>
<li>Assignment - who the task is for - setting for a User or a Team.</li>

<p>If you can't find what you are looking for in this Help Documentation please send us a <em>Help Ticket</em>  by clicking on the orange question mark that appears in the bottom left corner of the screen. </p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/Troubleshooting/image-20200819160826102.png" alt="image-20200819160826102" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>It is helpful for us if you are on the actual screen where you require help when submitting the ticket as it will give us a referral link to that page. A screen shot of the issue is also very useful (click on the camera icon).  </p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/Troubleshooting/image-20200819161435767.png" alt="image-20200819161435767" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Click on <em>Snap screenshot</em> or if you want to attach a file that is saved outside of Harbour Assist use the <em>Choose a file</em> option.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/Troubleshooting/image-20200819161315007.png" alt="image-20200819161315007" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>The screenshot or file will show that it is attached.</p>
<p>Now you can type in your message explaining what the problem is, then click on the <em>Next</em> button.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/Troubleshooting/image-20200819161955995.png" alt="image-20200819161955995" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Select the query type from the dropdown list and click on <em>Send Message</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.harbourassist.com/Troubleshooting/image-20200819162113196.png" alt="image-20200819162113196" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
<p>Once we receive the help request, it is triaged and passed to the most appropriate member of the team to investigate and respond.</p>
<p>An automated email acknowledging receipt of the Help Ticket will be sent to the <em>User</em> login email address.</p>
<p>Channeling all requests for help and reporting of issues through the ticketing system is important to ensure that there is no delay to responses (they are visible to all members of the HA team, rather than an email to 1 individual) and also helps us to see any pattern in issues that arise. </p>
<p>?&gt; NB. Help tickets are always prioritised over any other form of contact - so a direct email will not get a faster response. </p></body><br><hr/><head></head><body><h1 id="portaltroubleshooter">Portal Troubleshooter</h1>
<p>If a customer reports issues with logging into their portal please check the following:-</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Does the email address the customer is using to try to log in match the email address on their Harbour Assist account? If it doesn’t ask the customer whether they want to update their account email address.</p></li>
<li><p>Type the email address into the Search on the Home page – does it bring back more than 1 account? If so, this could be the problem. The Portal Login uses the customer email address as a unique identifier – if there is more than 1 account with this email address the system will not know which accounts portal to open.</p></li>
<li><p>If the email address is correct and there is only 1 account on the Account tab have a look at the Account Portal details. Here you can see whether the customer is registered or not and if they are registered you have to option to view their Portal Login Attempts.</p>

<li><p>View the customers Login Attempts – this will give you information about when they have tried to login and whether their attempt was successful or not – Green tick for Successful, Red cross for Unsuccessful.</p>

<li><p>If the customer has had 6 or more consecutive Unsuccessful login attempts, they will have been locked out. Advise the customer to use the Forgot your Password? Link on the Login Screen.</p>
