Logging Phone Calls & Meetings
===

The logging of a phone call or a meeting both work in exactly the same way, so in this example we will just cover a phone call.

From the *Account* screen select the *Comms* tab.

Select *Phone Call* (or *Meeting*).

Give your phone call a *subject* title - this title will appear in the *Comms* summary so be as clear as possible so that other colleagues looking at the communications have a good idea what the call was about without having to view it.

Select *Outgoing or Incoming* - again this will be logged in the *Comms* summary - and then give the pertinent details of the call.

At any point during the logging of a phone call process you can save your note - this will save it as a draft which is still fully editable.

Once you have finished making the notes, select *Commit*

This will log the phone call and it can no longer be edited.

To exit this screen, click on the *back* arrow.

Going back to the *Comms* tab, you will see the phone call is now shown in the list of communications for that account.
