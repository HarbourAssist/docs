# v2022.1 #

## Portal Translation ##

To cater for your international customers, they can now view the portal/payment pages in a variety of languages.  Languages currently supported are:

- English (US, Aus and UK regional)
- German
- Arabic
- Spanish (Spain and Catalan regional)
- French
- Italian
- Dutch
- Portuguese (Portugal and Brazilian dialects)

Users typically don't need to do anything, we'll pick up their browser language (which detects it from their device; this is usually set up when you first buy it).  Users can override this via a dropdown at the top right.

A couple of things to note:

- These translations are provided by Microsoft Azure's machine translation service.  If anyone speaks any of the above and would like to refine these translations or if you spot a contextually incorrect translation, please let us know.
- If the current users' browser language can't be found, by default it falls back to English; if you wish us to configure you so that it falls back to another language (e.g. Arabic for our Middle Eastern customers), please let us know.
- If you wish to have further languages added please let us know.  A full list of possible languages can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/translator/language-support).

## Minor improvements ##

- Angular upgraded to v13.
