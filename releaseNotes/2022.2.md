You can now 'Tag' records to mark them with category or to indicate they belong to a group of associated records.  Tags are completely customisable by you, and you can use them to do things like:

- Indicate a Customer is a VIP or Member.
- Mark an Order for payment chasing.
- Indicate a Boat is carrying dangerous goods.
- Mark an Asset as under maintance.
- Mark a Boat as being "Out of Marina".

The Tags available are entirely customisable, including label, colour, icon and animation should you really want to draw users attention to it's existence.

We've also provided some tools to help you manage tags.

- 100% integrated into all Smart Lists to allow you to report on and communicate based on Tag combinations.
- Tag Browser - allows quick way of diving into which records have combinations of tags.
- Tag History - shows when Tags have been added / removed from records.  Downloadable to Excel.

## Smart List Improvements ##

- Tagging integrated.
- Criteria selection is now grouped into logical sections to help you find the criteria easier.
