# Creating Letters in Bulk (Mail Merge)

Although we now live in an age where most communications are sent by email, there are still some things that are better sent by post and some customers who prefer to receive correspondence by post.  Using the Mail Merge feature in Harbour Assists means you can create personalised letters quickly and easily.

From the *Home* screen click on *Smart List Hub*.

Complete the following steps:-

1. Who do you want to mail? Do you want to create a letter for all records on the Smart List, or just those who prefer letters because you are sending a bulk email to those who prefer emails?

2. Pagination. How do you want your letters to print out?

3. Document Format.  Do you want the letters to be created as a PDF file (not editable) or Word (editable).

4. Records to Output. Can your printer cope with a multiple page print?  If it has a tendency to get jammed it may be better to print a few records at a time (1 - 10, then 11-20 etc).

5. Select Template. Select which template you want to use.  

   ?> For more documentation about allocating Templates click [here](communications/LetterTemplates.md).

6. Subject.  Give you letter a subject - this won't be seen by the customer, but it will help you find the letter in the Communications tab.

7. Letter Body. Create the body of your letter if this isn't already part of your template.
