# Creating a Visitor Order

You can create a visitor order from a number of areas within Harbour Assist, such as the Occupancy Calendar, Mapping or from a Customer Account.

Wherever you choose to create a Visitor Order in the system, you can create advance bookings, or raise on Order on the day of arrival.

There isn't a right or wrong option, they all create an Order and only the sequence of information differs.

For example:

##### Creating a Visitor Order from the Occupancy Calendar.

- Select the Asset/Berth the Visitor will be occupying during their stay.
- Select a Start and Departure date from the Asset line.
- Confirm the Occupancy Type.
- Search for an existing Account/Boat, or create a new account in the same way as you would from the Home Page.
- Raise a Visitor Order.

##### Creating a Visitor Order from an Account.

- Use the Search Tool to find an existing Account, or create a new Account.
- Raise a Visitor Order in the Customer Account.
- Select the Start and Departure dates.
- Select the Asset.
- Complete the Order as normal, adding any relevant Tariffs.

##### Creating a Visitor Order from a Map.

- Select the Asset/Berth by clicking on the Marker.
- Add an Occupancy and select the Occupancy Type.
- Search for an existing Account/Boat, or create a new account in the same way as you would from the Home Page.
- Select a Start and Departure date.
- Raise a Visitor Order.
