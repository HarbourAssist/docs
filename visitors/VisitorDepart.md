# Managing Visitors #

## Overview ##

When dealing with Visiting craft, customers will inevitably change their minds, therefore the *Visitor Depart* function has been developed to:-

- Allow customers to change their mind and the system re-calculate what they owe,
- ensure that all visitor revenue is captured. 

For this function to work correctly, all Visitor Occupancies must now be *Departed*.

To manage your Visitors, from the *Home* page, select *Visitor Depart*.

In the *Visitor Depart* screen, ensure the correct site is selected (for multi-site operators).  The screen will automatically populate to show all **Asset Types** that are currently **Occupied** with a **Visitor** occupancy and historic Visitor Occupancies who have not yet been marked as Departed.

?> NB. To view Visitors who may be on Unusable Assets, please ensure you check the *Include Unusable* box.

The symbols in the *Depart* column mean you can easily see craft who are due to leave that day, the next day or who have *overstayed* their original intended occupancy.

The Order details are shown - **Order** Number and Status (Confirmed or Draft), **Cost**, how much has been **Paid**, **Outstanding** amount and **Payment** status.

If a Visitor Occupancy has been created and no order raised, the Visitor will show and there will be a *New Visitor Order* button showing in the Order/Schedule column. Use this to raise a Visitor Order for the Occupancy.
